| **1.1**        | Unquestioning compliance with apparent authority       | The uniform commands, the mind obeys—question the order, not the rank. |
| **1.2**        | Diffusion of responsibility in hierarchical structures | "Someone else's problem" is the mantra of a breached defense. |
| **1.3**        | Authority figure impersonation susceptibility          | A title is just a word; verify the person behind the name.   |
| **1.4**        | Bypassing security for superior's convenience          | A shortcut for a leader becomes a highway for an attacker.   |
