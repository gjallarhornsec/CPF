## Executive Summary

The CPF Maturity Model provides organizations with a structured pathway to assess and improve their psychological resilience against cyber threats. Based on the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework's 100 indicators, this model defines five maturity levels that organizations progress through as they develop sophisticated pre-cognitive vulnerability management capabilities.
