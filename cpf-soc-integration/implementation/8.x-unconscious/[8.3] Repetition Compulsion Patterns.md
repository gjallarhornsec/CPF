### **[8.3] Repetition Compulsion Patterns**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The unconscious tendency to repeat past security mistakes or procedural failures, often under similar circumstances (e.g., time of day, type of alert), despite awareness of the correct procedure.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Repeated Error Rate (RER). Formula: `RER = Count_of_Repeated_Error_Events / Total_Error_Events`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_rer(analyst_id, start_date, end_date):
      # 1. Query all recorded error events from ticketing or SOAR playbook logs
      all_errors = query_errors(analyst_id, start_date, end_date)  # e.g., misclassified tickets, failed playbook steps
  
      # 2. Cluster errors by type and context (e.g., same error type, similar time, similar asset)
      repeated_errors = 0
      for error in all_errors:
          # Find similar past errors by the same analyst (e.g., within last 30 days)
          similar_past_errors = find_similar_errors(analyst_id, error, time_delta=30)
          if similar_past_errors:
              repeated_errors += 1
  
      # 3. Calculate ratio
      rer = repeated_errors / len(all_errors) if all_errors else 0
      return rer
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `RER > 0.3` (30% of errors are repeats of a previous mistake).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **SOAR Platform:** Logs of playbook execution errors (fields `user`, `playbook_name`, `error_type`, `timestamp`, `asset_involved`).
- **Ticketing System:** Jira/ServiceNow API for tickets marked as "incorrectly classified" or "reopened" due to analyst error (fields `assignee`, `status`, `status_changes`, `comments`).
- **SIEM:** Logs of manual override actions that later proved to be incorrect.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Review past incident reports involving the individual/team in a blameless post-mortem format. Ask: "We've seen a similar issue before. What was different about the context this time? What could we put in place to make the correct action more automatic or easier to remember next time?"

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement "just-in-time" training in SOAR playbooks; if a user fails a step, the system immediately offers a micro-training module on that specific action.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Integrate blameless post-mortems into the standard operating procedure to break the cycle of shame and repetition.
- **Process Mitigation:** Create and maintain a "common errors" checklist for specific high-stakes procedures to be consulted before finalizing an action.
