### **[8.1] Shadow projection onto attackers**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A psychological defense mechanism where an individual or group attributes their own unacceptable or negative impulses, intentions, and traits (their "Shadow") exclusively onto external attackers, creating a blind spot to internal threats and fostering an "us vs. them" mentality that weakens holistic defense.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Projection-to-Internal-Threat Ratio (PITR). Formula: `PITR = (Mentions of external attribution in incident reports) / (Mentions of internal factors in incident reports)`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_pitr(incident_reports, start_date, end_date):
      """
      incident_reports: Collection of post-incident report documents
      """
      # 1. NLP Keyword Lists
      external_keywords = ['hacker', 'nation-state', 'external', 'cybercriminal', 'them', 'china', 'russia', 'outsider']
      internal_keywords = ['misconfiguration', 'error', 'employee', 'insider', 'process', 'training', 'us', 'our', 'policy']
  
      total_external_mentions = 0
      total_internal_mentions = 0
  
      for report in incident_reports:
          if start_date <= report.date <= end_date:
              text = report.title + " " + report.root_cause_analysis
              # 2. Count keyword occurrences (simple bag-of-words approach)
              external_count = count_keywords(text, external_keywords)
              internal_count = count_keywords(text, internal_keywords)
  
              total_external_mentions += external_count
              total_internal_mentions += internal_count
  
      # 3. Calculate PITR, avoid division by zero
      if total_internal_mentions > 0:
          PITR = total_external_mentions / total_internal_mentions
      else:
          PITR = total_external_mentions  # If no internal factors are cited, ratio is high by definition.
      return PITR
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `PITR > 3.0` (External threats are mentioned 3x more often than internal factors in root cause analysis)

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Incident Management Platform (Jira, ServiceNow):** Fields: `post_mortem_report`, `root_cause_analysis`, `title`.
- **NLP Text Processing:** A simple keyword counter or a more sophisticated sentiment/theme analysis model trained to identify attribution language.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
A neutral third party (e.g., an auditor or external consultant) reviews a sample of incident reports and conducts interviews with the report authors. They use structured questioning: "What evidence led you to conclude the threat was primarily external? How thoroughly did you investigate potential internal contributing factors?" The goal is to identify assumptions and unchallenged narratives.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Configure the incident management system to require a mandatory field in the root cause analysis that must list at least one potential internal process or human factor that could have contributed to the incident's impact, even if external.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Conduct training on cognitive biases and defense mechanisms for the incident response team, specifically focusing on Jung's concept of the Shadow and how it manifests in cybersecurity.
- **Process Mitigation:** Integrate a mandatory "Red Team" or "Devil's Advocate" step into the incident review process, where a designated individual's role is to argue against the prevailing narrative and propose alternative, internal-cause hypotheses.
