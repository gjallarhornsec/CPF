### **[8.6] Defense Mechanism Interference**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The unconscious use of psychological defense mechanisms (e.g., denial, rationalization, projection) that actively interfere with performing security duties, such as dismissing clear evidence of a breach.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Evidence Dismissal Ratio (EDR). Formula: `EDR = Count_of_Dismissed_High_Confidence_IoCs / Total_High_Confidence_IoCs_Presented`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_edr(analyst_id, start_date, end_date):
      # 1. Query high-confidence Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from threat intel fed to the analyst
      # (e.g., from Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) or SIEM alert)
      high_confidence_iocs = query_iocs(confidence_min=85, analyst_id, start_date, end_date)
  
      # 2. Query the analyst's actions on these IoCs (e.g., dismissed, ignored, ruled out)
      dismissed_iocs = 0
      for ioc in high_confidence_iocs:
          if get_ioc_status(ioc, analyst_id) in ['dismissed', 'ignored', 'false_positive']:
              dismissed_iocs += 1
  
      # 3. Calculate ratio
      edr = dismissed_iocs / len(high_confidence_iocs) if high_confidence_iocs else 0
      return edr
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `EDR > 0.1` (Dismissing more than 10% of high-confidence threat intelligence).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP):** API to get IoCs (fields `ioc_value`, `ioc_type`, `confidence_score`, `timestamp`).
- **SIEM/SOAR:** Logs of analyst actions on alerts containing these IoCs (fields `user`, `action`, `alert_id`, `ioc_value`).

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Present the analyst with a recent case where they dismissed a high-confidence IoC in a simulated exercise. Use a cognitive interview technique: "Talk me through your thought process when you saw this indicator. What other possibilities did you consider? What would have needed to be different for you to escalate this?"

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a "second look" rule in the SOAR: if an analyst dismisses a high-confidence IoC, it is automatically queued for a brief review by another analyst or a senior.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Integrate training on cognitive biases and defense mechanisms into security awareness programs for SOC analysts.
- **Process Mitigation:** Mandate a "pre-mortem" for major incident closures, where the team briefly assumes the breach *did* happen and must list what evidence they might have missed.
