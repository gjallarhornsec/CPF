### **[8.8] Archetypal Activation Triggers**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The activation of universal, innate patterns of behavior ("archetypes") such as "The Hero," "The Trickster," or "The Shadow" by certain cyber events, leading to predictable but often irrational collective responses.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Archetypal Narrative Score (ANS). Formula: `ANS = NLP_Sentiment_Analysis(Commms, [ARCHETYPAL_KEYWORDS])`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_ans(team_channel_id, start_date, end_date):
      # 1. Fetch communications from a team channel during a specific incident
      messages = query_team_messages(team_channel_id, start_date, end_date)
  
      # 2. Use NLP to analyze sentiment and detect archetypal language patterns
      archetypal_patterns = {
          'hero': ['i alone', 'save the day', 'on my shoulders'],
          'trickster': ['clever hack', 'fooled them', 'too smart'],
          'shadow': ['they are evil', 'pure malice', 'dark intent']
      }
  
      archetype_score = 0
      for message in messages:
          for archetype, keywords in archetypal_patterns.items():
              if any(keyword in message.text.lower() for keyword in keywords):
                  # Use sentiment to weight the score (e.g., strong emotion = higher score)
                  sentiment = analyze_sentiment(message.text)
                  archetype_score += (1 * abs(sentiment))
  
      # 3. Normalize score by number of messages
      ans = archetype_score / len(messages) if messages else 0
      return ans
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `ANS > 0.7` (A high concentration of emotionally charged archetypal language).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Communication Platforms:** Slack/Teams API (fields `channel_id`, `user`, `text`, `timestamp`). *Must use aggregated, anonymized data.*
- **Incident Response Reports:** NLP analysis of post-incident report narratives.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
A psychologist or seasoned facilitator reviews the communication logs from a major incident (with identifiers removed) and identifies the emergence of archetypal narratives. They then lead a workshop with the team to reflect on these patterns and their impact on decision-making.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** (Limited) Develop a lightweight NLP bot that flags excessive use of emotionally charged, archetypal language in major incident channels and suggests a calming phrase.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Train incident commanders and team leads on group psychology and archetypes to help them recognize and gently counter these narratives in real-time ("Let's stay focused on the process, we're a team handling this together").
- **Process Mitigation:** Incorporate a "narrative check" into the incident response playbook, perhaps at a major milestone, to pause and assess if the team's story about the event is helping or hindering the response.
