### **[6.9] Organizational Splitting**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A Kleinian defense mechanism where the organization unconsciously splits itself into "all-good" (idealized) and "all-bad" (demonized) parts. This manifests as a rigid separation and lack of communication between teams (e.g., "Dev" vs. "Ops", "Blue Team" vs. "Red Team"), blame-shifting, and a failure to integrate security into development lifecycles.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Cross-Team Collaboration Index (CTCI). Formula: `(Number of shared channels/threads/tickets between Team A and Team B) / (Total activity of Team A and Team B)`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_ctci(team_a, team_b, start_date, end_date):
      """
      team_a, team_b: Lists of user identifiers.
      """
      # Get messages/tickets involving members from both teams
      cross_team_items = get_shared_items(team_a, team_b, start_date, end_date)
      # Get all messages/tickets for both teams
      total_team_a_items = get_activity(team_a, start_date, end_date)
      total_team_b_items = get_activity(team_b, start_date, end_date)
      total_activity = total_team_a_items + total_team_b_items
      return len(cross_team_items) / total_activity if total_activity > 0 else 0
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `CTCI < 0.05` (Less than 5% of total activity involves cross-team collaboration).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Collaboration Platform API (Slack/Teams):** Data: `messages` in shared channels, `replies`, `mentions` between members of different teams.
- **Ticketing System API (Jira):** Data: `issues` with participants/commenters from multiple teams, `issue_links` between tickets from different teams.

**4. Human-To-Human Audit Protocol:**
Conduct a workshop with representatives from both teams. Present the low CTCI metric. Use a blame-free format like "What are the barriers to working more closely with team X? What would make collaboration easier? What is one small project we could do together next quarter?"

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Create mandatory shared digital spaces for projects (e.g., a `#app-sec-dev-collab` channel for every development squad that includes a dedicated security engineer).
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Implement a job rotation program where security engineers embed within development teams for short periods, and vice-versa.
- **Process Mitigation:** Shift security left by integrating security goals and metrics into the development teams' Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), making it a shared responsibility, not a separate "gate."
