### **[6.10] Collective Defense Mechanisms**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The unconscious, organization-wide use of psychological defenses (e.g., denial, rationalization, projection) to avoid anxiety associated with security threats. This manifests as a systematic downplaying of risk metrics, attributing breaches solely to "sophisticated nation-states" (projection), or believing "it won't happen to us" (denial).

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Risk Rationalization Ratio (RRR). Formula: `(Number of confirmed true positive alerts) / (Number of alerts initially closed as 'false positive' or 'risk accepted')`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_rrr(alerts):
      true_positives = 0
      rationalized_alerts = 0
      for alert in alerts:
          if alert.final_verdict == "True Positive":
              true_positives += 1
          if alert.initial_closure_reason in ["False Positive", "Risk Accepted", "Not Applicable"]:
              rationalized_alerts += 1
      return true_positives / rationalized_alerts if rationalized_alerts > 0 else 0
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `RRR > 0.1` (More than 10% of alerts initially dismissed are actually true positives, indicating a pattern of rationalization/denial).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **SIEM/SOAR:** Alert queue. Fields: `initial_closure_reason`, `final_verdict` (from later investigation or pentest findings), `severity`.

**4. Human-To-Human Audit Protocol:**
In a blameless post-incident review meeting for a missed true positive, focus on the initial triage decision. Ask: "What was the thought process behind initially closing this as a non-issue? Was there any pressure, conscious or unconscious, to make the alert queue go down? Did we convince ourselves it was fine because dealing with it would have been difficult?"

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a mandatory peer review step for closing any high-severity alert as a false positive. Require a second opinion.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Leadership must actively foster a culture of psychological safety where speaking up about risks and admitting mistakes is rewarded, not punished. Discuss cognitive biases openly.
- **Process Mitigation:** Institute a regular (e.g., quarterly) "alert audit" process where a sample of closed alerts, especially those dismissed as FP, is re-examined by a different team (e.g., Red Team) to validate the conclusions.
