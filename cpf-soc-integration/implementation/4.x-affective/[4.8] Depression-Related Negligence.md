### **[4.8] Depression-Related Negligence**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A state of low energy, motivation, and hopelessness that manifests as apathy towards security protocols, missed alerts, and a general pattern of neglect in routine security hygiene tasks.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Task Neglect Rate (TNR). Formula: `TNR = N_overdue_tasks / N_total_assigned_tasks`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_tnr(ticketing_system, user_id):
      """
      Fetches tasks from a ticketing system (e.g., Vuln remediation, alert review).
      """
      # Get all tasks assigned to the user that are past their due date
      users_tasks = query_jira(f'assignee = {user_id} AND status != Done')
      overdue_tasks = [t for t in users_tasks if t['due_date'] < datetime.now()]
  
      tnr = len(overdue_tasks) / len(users_tasks) if users_tasks else 0
      return tnr
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `TNR > 0.25` for a sustained period (e.g., 2 weeks). (A quarter of tasks are consistently overdue).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Ticketing System (Jira/ServiceNow):** API to query tasks by assignee and due date.
- **Vulnerability Management System:** API to pull overdue remediation tasks.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:** This requires sensitive, confidential handling by a manager or HR. Look for patterns of absence, withdrawal from team communication, and a drop in productivity. A supportive, private conversation is required, not an audit.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Use automation to handle the most repetitive and mundane tasks (e.g., auto-patching low-risk systems).
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** **This is primarily a mental health and management issue.** Ensure managers are trained to recognize signs of burnout and depression and have clear pathways to offer support (EAP, HR).
- **Process Mitigation:** Implement workload balancing and regular check-ins to prevent any one individual from becoming overwhelmed.
