### **[4.2] Anger-Induced Risk Taking**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A state where heightened anger leads security personnel to bypass protocols, make hasty decisions, or engage in aggressive retaliation against perceived threats, thereby increasing system instability and creating new attack surfaces.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Anger-Induced Action Ratio (AIAR). Formula: `AIAR = N_rapid_high_severity_actions / N_total_high_severity_actions`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_aiar(actions_log, user_id, time_window='1h'):
      """
      actions_log: List of dicts with keys ['user', 'action_type', 'severity', 'timestamp', 'time_to_execute']
      """
      # Filter for the specific user's high-severity actions (e.g., block IP, quarantine device)
      user_actions = [a for a in actions_log if a['user'] == user_id and a['severity'] == 'high']
  
      # Define a threshold for a "rapid" action (e.g., < 2 minutes from alert to action suggests minimal deliberation)
      rapid_action_threshold = 120  # seconds
  
      # Count actions performed faster than the threshold
      rapid_actions = [a for a in user_actions if a['time_to_execute'] < rapid_action_threshold]
  
      # Calculate the ratio
      aiar = len(rapid_actions) / len(user_actions) if user_actions else 0
      return aiar
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `AIAR > 0.3` (More than 30% of high-sev actions are performed with minimal deliberation).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **SOAR Platform Logs:** (e.g., Splunk Phantom, Cortex XSOAR) API to fetch playbook execution logs, including `user`, `action_name`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and severity tags from the triggering alert.
- **SIEM/Syslog:** Authentication and command logs from critical systems (e.g., firewall admin logs, EDR console logs) to capture manual, out-of-band actions.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Conduct a confidential, anonymous survey with scenario-based questions: "You receive a taunting message from an attacker on a critical system. What is your first instinct?" and provide multiple-choice answers. Follow up in 1-on-1 interviews after critical incidents to discuss the decision-making process and emotional state.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a "cool-down" mandatory delay for high-impact SOAR playbooks, requiring a second analyst approval for execution within the first 5 minutes.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Integrate de-escalation and emotional regulation techniques into security training. Establish a buddy system for peer review during high-tension incidents.
- **Process Mitigation:** Create a post-incident review checklist that explicitly includes analyzing the emotional state of responders and its impact on decisions.
