### **[4.10] Emotional Contagion Effects**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The rapid spread of negative emotional states (e.g., panic, frustration, cynicism) through a team or organization, amplifying individual affective vulnerabilities and leading to collective, correlated degradation in security performance.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Emotional Synchrony Index (ESI). Formula: `ESI = Cross-Correlation(Team_Member_A_MTTA, Team_Member_B_MTTA)`.
  *We measure the correlation of performance metrics across team members over time.*

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_esi(metric_log, team_list, time_period='30d'):
      """
      metric_log: A time series of a performance metric (e.g., MTTA, Ignore Rate) per analyst.
      """
      # Calculate the metric for each team member over the time period
      analyst_metrics = {}
      for analyst in team_list:
          analyst_metrics[analyst] = calculate_mtta_for_analyst(analyst, time_period)
  
      # Calculate the pairwise correlation between all team members
      correlation_sum = 0
      pair_count = 0
      analysts = list(analyst_metrics.keys())
  
      for i in range(len(analysts)):
          for j in range(i+1, len(analysts)):
              corr = pearson_correlation(analyst_metrics[analysts[i]], analyst_metrics[analysts[j]])
              correlation_sum += corr
              pair_count += 1
  
      # ESI is the average correlation across all pairs
      esi = correlation_sum / pair_count if pair_count else 0
      return esi
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `ESI > 0.7` (Strong positive correlation in performance degradation across the team, suggesting emotional contagion).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **SIEM/Ticketing System:** As in 4.1, to calculate individual MTTA, Ignore Rate, or other performance metrics over time.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:** Observe team communication channels for patterns of negative, absolutist language ("This is hopeless," "Everything is broken"). Conduct team retrospectives focused on psychological safety and group dynamics.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Use the ESI metric as an early warning system to trigger management intervention.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Train team leads in emotional intelligence and group facilitation. Introduce team resilience exercises.
- **Process Mitigation:** Create clear protocols for team leads to initiate a "reset" after a difficult period, such as a facilitated debrief or a change in rotation.
