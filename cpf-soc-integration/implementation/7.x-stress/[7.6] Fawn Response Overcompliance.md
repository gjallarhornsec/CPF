### **[7.6] Fawn Response Overcompliance**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A stress-induced response to appease authority figures or systems by following procedures to an excessive, unthinking degree, often bypassing critical thinking and leading to errors (e.g., approving a risky request from a superior without scrutiny).

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** **Blind Approval Rate (BAR)**. Formula: `BAR = N_approvals_with_short_review / N_total_approvals`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_bar(employee_id, start_date, end_date):
      # Get all approval actions performed by the employee (e.g., access requests, firewall rule changes)
      approvals = query_iam_system(employee_id, start_date, end_date)
      
      blind_approvals = 0
      for approval in approvals:
          # Define "short review" as less than 60 seconds between request and approval
          review_time = approval.approval_time - approval.request_time
          if review_time < timedelta(seconds=60):
              blind_approvals += 1
      
      total_approvals = len(approvals)
      if total_approvals > 0:
          bar = blind_approvals / total_approvals
      else:
          bar = 0
      return bar
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `BAR > 0.3` (30% of approvals are done in under 60 seconds).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM) System API (e.g., SailPoint, Okta Workflows):** `approver`, `request_time`, `decision_time`, `decision`.
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM) System Logs.**

**4. Human-To-Human Audit Protocol:**
Sample audit of approved requests. In an interview, present a recent, approved request and ask: "Can you talk me through the factors you considered before approving this?" "Did you feel any pressure to approve this quickly?"

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a mandatory 2-minute "cooling-off" period for all high-risk approvals. Require a mandatory comment field for any approval.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Training on assertiveness and security governance. Reinforce that the security team's authority to deny requests is supported by leadership.
- **Process Mitigation:** Introduce a "four-eyes" principle for approvals coming from high-authority figures.
