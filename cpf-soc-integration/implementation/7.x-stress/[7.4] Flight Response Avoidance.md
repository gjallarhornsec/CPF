### **[7.4] Flight Response Avoidance**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A stress-induced response where an individual avoids or delays engaging with stressful security tasks (like complex alerts or incident response), manifesting as procrastination, task abandonment, or deflection of responsibility.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** **Task Avoidance Rate (TAR)**. Formula: `TAR = N_reassigned_or_unclaimed_tasks / N_total_tasks_assigned`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_tar(employee_id, start_date, end_date):
      # Get all high-severity tasks assigned to the employee
      assigned_tasks = query_jira_api(f'assignee = {employee_id} AND created >= {start_date} AND created <= {end_date} AND severity in ("high", "critical")')
      
      # Count tasks that were reassigned or left unclaimed until timeout
      avoided_tasks = 0
      for task in assigned_tasks:
          if task.status == "Reassigned" or (task.status == "Open" and task.time_since_assignment > "24h"):
              avoided_tasks += 1
      
      total_tasks = len(assigned_tasks)
      
      if total_tasks > 0:
          tar = avoided_tasks / total_tasks
      else:
          tar = 0
      return tar
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `TAR > 0.2` (20% of high-severity tasks are avoided).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Ticketing System API (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow):** `assignee`, `created`, `status`, `status_history`, `priority`.

**4. Human-To-Human Audit Protocol:**
Structured interview with the employee and their manager: "When was the last time you felt overwhelmed by a task and didn't know where to start?" "Can you walk me through your process when a critical alert is assigned to you?" Review workload and task complexity.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Improve task assignment logic to better match skill sets and current workload. Implement a "request help" button in the ticketing system that automatically pings a senior analyst.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Establish a mentorship program. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks with clear instructions.
- **Process Mitigation:** Introduce clearer escalation paths and define explicit criteria for when a task can be legitimately reassigned.
