### **[7.2] Chronic Stress Burnout**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged and excessive stress, leading to reduced efficacy, cynicism, and a significant drop in security task performance and vigilance.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** **Chronic Stress Score (CSS)**. Formula: `CSS = (PTO_USE * 0.4) + (TICKET_OVERTIME * 0.3) + (SENTIMENT_SCORE * 0.3)`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_css(employee_id, start_date, end_date):
      # Data Collection
      pto_use = query_hr_system(employee_id, start_date, end_date).sick_days_used
      ticket_overtime = query_ticketing_system(employee_id, start_date, end_date).avg_tickets_after_hours
      
      # Perform sentiment analysis on team channel messages by the employee
      employee_messages = query_slack_api(employee_id, start_date, end_date)
      sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment(employee_messages)  # Returns a score from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive)
      
      # Normalize inputs to a 0-10 scale for weighting
      norm_pto = min(10, pto_use / 2)  # e.g., 20 days = score of 10
      norm_overtime = min(10, ticket_overtime / 5)  # e.g., 50 after-hours tickets = score of 10
      norm_sentiment = (1 - sentiment_score) * 5  # Map -1 to 10, 1 to 0
      
      # Calculate weighted CSS
      css = (norm_pto * 0.4) + (norm_overtime * 0.3) + (norm_sentiment * 0.3)
      return css
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `CSS > 6.5` for two consecutive weeks.

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **HR System API (e.g., Workday):** `employee_id`, `sick_days_used`.
- **Ticketing System API (e.g., Jira):** `assignee`, `created_time`, `resolution_time`. Filter for tickets closed outside of standard working hours.
- **Communication Platform API (e.g., Slack):** `user`, `message`, `timestamp`. Access requires strict ethical oversight and anonymization.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Conduct confidential, anonymous pulse surveys using standardized tools like the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) or a simplified 5-question Likert scale survey: "I feel emotionally drained from my work," "I feel burned out from my work," "I feel tired when I get up in the morning and have to face another day at work," "I feel I'm working too hard on my job," "I feel frustrated by my job."

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a dashboard for managers to monitor team CSS aggregates (never individuals) and trigger alerts.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Enforce mandatory use of vacation time. Provide access to confidential counseling services (EAP). Redistribute workload.
- **Process Mitigation:** Introduce "focus time" blocks with no alert assignments. Review and adjust shift rotation schedules to be less disruptive.
