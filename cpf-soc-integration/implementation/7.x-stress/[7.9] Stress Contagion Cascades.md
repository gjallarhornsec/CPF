### **[7.9] Stress Contagion Cascades**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The phenomenon where the stress state of one individual (e.g., a team lead or senior analyst) spreads rapidly through a team via verbal and non-verbal cues, degrading the collective cognitive performance and decision-making quality of the entire group.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** **Stress Cascade Index (SCI)**. Formula: `SCI = Cross-Correlation(Stress_Metric_User_A, Stress_Metric_Team)`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_sci(team_id, start_date, end_date):
      # Calculate a daily stress metric for each team member (e.g., using CSS from 7.2 or ticket backlog)
      team_stress_levels = {}
      for member in get_team_members(team_id):
          css = calculate_css(member.id, start_date, end_date)  # From 7.2
          team_stress_levels[member.id] = css
      
      # Calculate the team's average stress level per day
      team_avg_stress = np.mean(list(team_stress_levels.values()))
      
      # Calculate correlation of each member's stress with the team average
      sci_scores = {}
      for member, stress in team_stress_levels.items():
          # This is a simplification. A real implementation would use time-series data.
          correlation = np.corrcoef([stress], [team_avg_stress])[0, 1]
          sci_scores[member] = correlation
      
      # Identify the individual with the highest correlation (the potential contagion source)
      max_sci_member = max(sci_scores, key=sci_scores.get)
      return max_sci_member, sci_scores[max_sci_member]
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `SCI > 0.8` for a key individual (e.g., team lead) over a one-month period.

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **HR System:** `team_membership`.
- **All data sources from other stress metrics (7.1-7.8) aggregated at the team level.**

**4. Human-To-Human Audit Protocol:**
Team facilitator observation during incidents or high-pressure periods. Anonymous team climate surveys asking: "How does the mood of your team lead affect your own stress levels?"

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Create team-level dashboards that monitor aggregate stress metrics to identify teams at risk.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Provide leadership training for senior analysts and team leads on emotional intelligence and managing team dynamics under pressure.
- **Process Mitigation:** Institute structured briefings and debriefings ("hotwashes") to manage emotions and perceptions before and after stressful events.
