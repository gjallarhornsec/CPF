### **[1.1] Unquestioning compliance with apparent authority**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A vulnerability where security personnel automatically comply with requests from individuals perceived as authority figures, without performing necessary verification checks, increasing the risk of successful social engineering attacks like CEO fraud.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Unverified Authority Request Rate (UARR). Formula: `UARR = (Number of unverified high-impact requests from "authorities") / (Total number of high-impact requests from "authorities")`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_uarr(access_logs, comms_data, start_date, end_date):
      """
      access_logs: List of logs from network/access control systems
      comms_data: List of messages from email/chat platforms
      """
      # 1. Identify potential authority figures (e.g., C-level, VPs) from HR data or comms patterns
      authority_users = identify_authority_figures(comms_data)
  
      # 2. Extract all high-impact requests from these users (e.g., password reset, access grant)
      authority_requests = [
          req for req in extract_requests(comms_data, start_date, end_date)
          if req.sender in authority_users and req.impact == 'high'
      ]
  
      # 3. Cross-reference with access logs to check for verification (e.g., ticket ID, 2FA)
      unverified_count = 0
      for req in authority_requests:
          # Check if the request was followed by an action without a linked, approved ticket
          corresponding_actions = find_corresponding_actions(access_logs, req)
          if not was_request_verified(corresponding_actions):
              unverified_count += 1
  
      # 4. Calculate UARR
      total_requests = len(authority_requests)
      UARR = unverified_count / total_requests if total_requests > 0 else 0
      return UARR
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `UARR > 0.2` (More than 20% of high-impact authority requests are executed without verification)

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Email/Chat Platforms (Microsoft Graph API, Slack API):** To extract requests containing high-impact keywords (`"need access to"`, `"reset password for"`, `"urgent"`) from senders identified as authority figures.
- **IAM/Active Directory Logs:** To verify if a requested action was performed.
- **Ticketing System API (Jira, ServiceNow):** To check if an action was linked to an approved, validated ticket.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Conduct a simulated phishing exercise targeting SOC analysts with a message impersonating a known company executive (e.g., CISO) requesting a high-impact action like disabling a security control. Measure the percentage of analysts who comply without seeking secondary verification via a different channel (e.g., a phone call).

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a mandatory technical workflow that blocks high-impact actions (e.g., privileged access grants) requested via chat/email unless they are linked to an approved ticket number in the system.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Conduct targeted training on authority bias, focusing on established verification procedures for all requests, regardless of the perceived seniority of the requester.
- **Process Mitigation:** Formalize a "4-eyes principle" in the SOC playbook for any action requested outside the ticketing system, requiring mandatory confirmation by a shift supervisor.
