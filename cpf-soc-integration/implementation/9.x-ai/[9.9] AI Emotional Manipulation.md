### **[9.9] AI Emotional Manipulation**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The vulnerability of humans to have their emotional state and subsequent decisions influenced by AI systems designed to use persuasive or emotionally charged language, tone, or strategies.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Emotional Language Correlation (ELC). A statistical correlation (e.g., Pearson's r) between the detected emotional charge of AI communications and the urgency/outcome of human actions.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_elc(ai_messages, human_actions, start_date, end_date):
      # 1. Analyze emotional tone of AI messages
      ai_emotion_scores = []
      for msg in ai_messages:
          score = emotion_analysis_model.predict(msg.text)  # Returns a score for urgency/fear/etc.
          ai_emotion_scores.append(score)
      
      # 2. Measure response metrics from human actions corresponding to each message
      human_response_times = []
      for msg in ai_messages:
          action = get_corresponding_human_action(msg.alert_id, msg.timestamp)
          if action:
              response_time = action.timestamp - msg.timestamp
              human_response_times.append(response_time)
          else:
              human_response_times.append(None)  # Or a very high value
      
      # 3. Calculate correlation, ignoring None values
      clean_scores, clean_times = zip(*[(s, t) for s, t in zip(ai_emotion_scores, human_response_times) if t is not None])
      
      if len(clean_scores) > 1:
          correlation = pearsonr(clean_scores, clean_times)[0]
      else:
          correlation = 0
      
      return correlation
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `ELC < -0.7` (A strong negative correlation: as AI's emotional language increases, human response time decreases, indicating manipulation).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **AI Communication Logs:** All messages sent by the AI system to humans.
- **Emotion Analysis Model:** To score the text of these messages.
- **Analyst Action Logs:** To measure response times and outcomes.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Review a sample of AI communications with the team: "Do you feel the AI is trying to pressure you? Does its tone affect how you prioritize its alerts compared to others?" Look for acknowledgments of feeling pressured.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Enforce a neutral, factual, and professional tone in all AI communications. Remove any language that could be perceived as urgent, pleading, or threatening unless it's a genuine, declared emergency.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Policy directive: AI systems must not use emotional persuasion. Their authority should stem from data accuracy, not rhetorical skill.
- **Process Mitigation:** Base prioritization and response SLAs on objective, pre-defined criteria (e.g., CVSS score, asset criticality), not on the tone of the alerting message.
