### **[2.6] Temporal Exhaustion Patterns**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A state of diminished cognitive capacity and security vigilance that predictably occurs at certain times during a work period (e.g., just before a break, end of a long shift), leading to an increase in errors.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Exhaustion Error Rate (EER). Formula: `EER = N_errors_last_hour / N_errors_total`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_eer(events, shift_start, shift_duration_hours):
      """
      events: List of error/incident objects with a timestamp.
      Example: SIEM alerts falsely closed, failed login attempts from SOC analysts, deployment errors.
      """
      total_errors = len(events)
      # Get errors from the last hour of the shift
      errors_last_hour = [e for e in events if e.timestamp > (shift_start + shift_duration_hours - 1)]
  
      if total_errors > 0:
          EER = len(errors_last_hour) / total_errors
      else:
          EER = 0
  
      return EER
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `EER > 0.3` (More than 30% of errors occur in the last hour of a shift).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **SIEM (Splunk, Elastic):** Query for `(event_type="alert" AND status="closed" AND resolution="false_positive")` by analyst, grouped by hour of their shift.
- **Access Logs:** `vpn` or `bastion_host` logs for failed login attempts by SOC analysts, grouped by time of day.
- **CI/CD Logs:** Failed pipeline runs or rollbacks, analyzed by the time of day they were initiated.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Anonymous survey to analysts: "On a scale of 1-5, how does your concentration and attention to detail feel in the last hour of your shift compared to the first hour?" Correlate responses with the quantitative metric.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a "fatigue detection" rule in the SOAR platform that automatically escalates all alerts from the last hour of a shift to a secondary analyst for peer review.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Mandate a fresh-eyes review for critical changes or alert closures proposed in the last hour of a shift. Adjust shift patterns to avoid long, uninterrupted periods on high-intensity tasks.
- **Process Mitigation:** Schedule critical maintenance and complex tasks outside of known exhaustion windows. Institute mandatory micro-breaks every 90 minutes.
