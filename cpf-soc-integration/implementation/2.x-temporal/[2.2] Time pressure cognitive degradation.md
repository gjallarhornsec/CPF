### **[2.2] Time pressure cognitive degradation**

**1. Operational Definition:**
A state where excessive time pressure impairs an analyst's cognitive functions (e.g., attention, memory, logical reasoning), leading to an increase in errors during security task performance.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Error Rate During High-Pressure Periods (ERHPP). Formula: `ERHPP = (Number of erroneous actions during high-pressure periods) / (Total actions during high-pressure periods)`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_erhpp(action_logs, ticket_data, pressure_threshold_minutes=30):
      """
      action_logs: Logs of analyst actions (e.g., alert closures, rule modifications)
      ticket_data: Ticket data to determine pressure periods (high volume + short deadlines)
      """
      # 1. Identify high-pressure periods (e.g., ticket volume > 90th percentile AND avg. deadline < threshold)
      pressure_periods = identify_high_pressure_periods(ticket_data, pressure_threshold_minutes)
  
      # 2. Filter actions that occurred during these periods
      actions_during_pressure = [
          action for action in action_logs
          if is_during_period(action.timestamp, pressure_periods)
      ]
  
      # 3. Identify erroneous actions (e.g., misclassified severity, incorrect asset tag, false negative)
      erroneous_actions = [
          action for action in actions_during_pressure
          if action.result == 'false_negative' or action.was_rolled_back is True
      ]
  
      # 4. Calculate ERHPP
      total_actions = len(actions_during_pressure)
      ERHPP = len(erroneous_actions) / total_actions if total_actions > 0 else 0
      return ERHPP
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `ERHPP > 0.25` (More than 25% of actions during high-pressure periods are erroneous)

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **SIEM/Ticketing System API:** To calculate ticket volume and deadline metrics to define pressure periods.
- **SOAR Platform Logs / Git History / Configuration Management Logs:** To get a detailed audit trail of analyst actions and their outcomes (e.g., `action`, `timestamp`, `user`, `success_status`, `rollback_status`).

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Conduct a retrospective analysis (blameless post-mortem) of a recent incident or false negative. Guide the discussion: "Walk us through your thought process during the event. What was the time pressure like? Did you feel it was difficult to concentrate or remember procedures at any point?"

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a "circuit breaker" in the SOAR platform that flags for supervisory review any high-severity action taken by an analyst who has been processing a high volume of tickets in a short time window.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Introduce mandatory, enforced micro-breaks (5 minutes every hour) during declared high-pressure incidents or periods of critical vulnerability patching.
- **Process Mitigation:** Develop and train on "high-pressure playbooks" that simplify decision trees and provide clear, step-by-step guidance for the most critical and time-sensitive tasks.
