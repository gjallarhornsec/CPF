### **[2.5] Hyperbolic Discounting of Future Threats**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The cognitive bias where the perceived cost of addressing a future potential threat is weighed as more significant than the actual, discounted future cost of a breach, leading to the perpetual deferral of mitigation actions.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Mitigation Deferral Index (MDI). Formula: `MDI = (N_vulns_deferred / N_vulns_identified) * Average_Deferral_Time`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_mdi(vulnerabilities):
      """
      vulnerabilities: List of vuln objects with fields: ['vuln_id', 'discovery_date', 'risk_rating', 'planned_remediation_date', 'actual_remediation_date']
      """
      deferred_vulns = []
      total_vulns = len(vulnerabilities)
  
      for vuln in vulnerabilities:
          if vuln.planned_remediation_date and vuln.actual_remediation_date:
              # If remediated later than planned, it was deferred
              if vuln.actual_remediation_date > vuln.planned_remediation_date:
                  deferral_time = (vuln.actual_remediation_date - vuln.planned_remediation_date).days
                  deferred_vulns.append(deferral_time)
  
      if total_vulns > 0 and len(deferred_vulns) > 0:
          deferral_rate = len(deferred_vulns) / total_vulns
          avg_deferral_time = sum(deferred_vulns) / len(deferred_vulns)
          MDI = deferral_rate * avg_deferral_time
      else:
          MDI = 0
  
      return MDI
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `MDI > 7` (e.g., A pattern where 10% of vulns are deferred by an average of 70 days, or 20% by 35 days).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **Vulnerability Management Platform (Qualys, Tenable):** `vulnerabilities` API. Fields: `discovered`, `severity`, `planned_remediation_date`, `remediated`.
- **Ticketing System (Jira, ServiceNow):** `issues` of type 'Risk Acceptance'. Fields: `created`, `risk_assessment.expiry_date`.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Review risk acceptance forms and meeting minutes from the past quarter: "What was the rationale for accepting this risk? Was a cost-benefit analysis done that compared the mitigation cost now vs. potential future loss? Has this finding been deferred before?"

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Configure the VM platform to automatically escalate and re-assign vulnerabilities whose planned remediation date has passed without action.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Train risk owners on proper quantitative risk assessment techniques, forcing a numerical evaluation of future cost.
- **Process Mitigation:** Implement a policy where any deferral of a "high" or "critical" vulnerability requires formal, time-bound risk acceptance signed by a business unit head, with mandatory quarterly reviews.
