### **[10.10] Hysteresis Security Gaps**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The lagging or persistent effect of a security incident or a period of high stress on the system or team, where performance or security posture does not return to its original state even after the initial cause has been removed.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Post-Incident Performance Decay (PIPD). Formula: `PIPD = (Baseline_MTTA - Post_Incident_MTTA) / Baseline_MTTA`. A negative value indicates performance is worse after the incident.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_pipd(team_id, major_incident_date):
      # Define time windows: 30 days before (baseline) and 30 days after (recovery)
      baseline_start = major_incident_date - timedelta(days=30)
      baseline_end = major_incident_date
      recovery_start = major_incident_date
      recovery_end = major_incident_date + timedelta(days=30)
      
      # Calculate MTTA for the baseline period
      baseline_mtta = calculate_mtta_team(baseline_start, baseline_end, team_id)
      
      # Calculate MTTA for the recovery period
      recovery_mtta = calculate_mtta_team(recovery_start, recovery_end, team_id)
      
      # Calculate the percentage change
      if baseline_mtta > 0:
          pipd = (recovery_mtta - baseline_mtta) / baseline_mtta
      else:
          pipd = 0
      return pipd  # e.g., -0.15 means a 15% slowdown after the incident
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `PIPD < -0.1` (A greater than 10% performance degradation persists for a month after a major incident).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **SIEM / SOAR:** For calculating `MTTA` for a specific team over defined time periods.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Conduct a "lessons learned" session 4-6 weeks after a major incident. Go beyond "what went wrong" and ask: "How is the team doing now? Are we still feeling the effects? Are we making different (perhaps overly cautious) decisions because of that event?" This qualitative data reveals hysteresis.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Use the PIPD metric to automatically trigger additional support resources (e.g., contractor SOC analysts) for teams recovering from a major incident.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Provide access to professional psychological support or counseling for teams after critical incidents to mitigate burnout and trauma.
- **Process Mitigation:** Formalize a post-incident recovery process that includes workload lightening, mentoring, and a phased return to full responsibilities for the affected team.
