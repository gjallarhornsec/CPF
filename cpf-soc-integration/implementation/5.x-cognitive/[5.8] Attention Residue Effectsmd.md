### **[5.8] Attention Residue Effects**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The negative impact on performance when switching from Task A to Task B, where cognitive resources are still partially occupied by the previous task, reducing focus and effectiveness on the new task.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** Time-to-Focus (TTF). Formula: `TTF = (Time between first opening a new alert and performing the first meaningful, unique investigative action on it)`. High TTF suggests attention residue from a previous task.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_ttf(events, alert_id):
      # Get events for this alert, sorted by time
      alert_events = get_events_for_alert(alert_id)
      open_time = None
      first_action_time = None
      
      for event in alert_events:
          if event.action == 'open' or event.action == 'assign':
              open_time = event.timestamp
          # Define what constitutes a "meaningful investigative action"
          if open_time and event.action in ['query_edr', 'run_yara', 'check_dns']:
              first_action_time = event.timestamp
              break
              
      if open_time and first_action_time:
          return (first_action_time - open_time).total_seconds() / 60  # Return time in minutes
      else:
          return None  # Data incomplete
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `TTF > 15 (minutes)` for high-severity alerts. The analyst is taking over 15 minutes to begin meaningful work on a critical alert.

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **SOAR/SIEM Audit Logs:** To get the precise timestamp when an alert was assigned/opened by an analyst.
- **Various Tool Audit Logs (EDR, DNS, etc.):** To get the timestamp of the first investigative action taken on the alert, which may occur outside the SIEM.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Ask an analyst to describe what they do in the first 5 minutes after picking up a new high-severity ticket. A vague or hesitant answer may indicate a lack of a clear protocol, exacerbating attention residue. Compare this with their measured TTF.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement a "handover" protocol in the ticketing system where the previous analyst must leave a brief, structured summary of the alert's context to reduce the cognitive load on the next analyst.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Encourage analysts to perform a brief "closure ritual" (e.g., writing one sentence on next steps) before switching tasks to mentally compartmentalize the previous work.
- **Process Mitigation:** Standardize the first 5 steps for investigating any new alert (e.g., 1. Check EDR, 2. Enrich IP, 3. Check auth logs). This reduces the decision load when starting a new task.
