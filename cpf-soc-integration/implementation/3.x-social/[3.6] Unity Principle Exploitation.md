### **[3.6] Unity Principle Exploitation**

**1. Operational Definition:**
The tendency to favor requests from individuals perceived to be part of one's "in-group" (e.g., same team, company, or background), leading to relaxed security scrutiny based on a false sense of shared identity.

**2. Main Metric & Algorithm:**

- **Metric:** **In-Group Preferential Treatment Index (IPTI)**. Formula: `IPTI = (N_bypass_in_group / N_requests_in_group) / (N_bypass_out_group / N_requests_out_group)`.

- **Pseudocode:**

  python

  ```
  def calculate_ipti(access_logs, request_logs, hr_data):
      """
      Compares bypass rates for in-group vs. out-group requests.
      """
      # 1. Define in-group (e.g., same department) and out-group
      user_departments = get_department_mapping(hr_data)
  
      in_group_requests = 0; in_group_bypass = 0
      out_group_requests = 0; out_group_bypass = 0
  
      for request in request_logs:
          requester = request.requester_id
          grantor = request.grantor_id
          # Check if requester and grantor are in the same in-group (department)
          if user_departments[requester] == user_departments[grantor]:
              in_group_requests += 1
              if request.was_bypassed: # e.g., no ticket, policy exception
                  in_group_bypass += 1
          else:
              out_group_requests += 1
              if request.was_bypassed:
                  out_group_bypass += 1
  
      bypass_rate_in = in_group_bypass / in_group_requests if in_group_requests > 0 else 0
      bypass_rate_out = out_group_bypass / out_group_requests if out_group_requests > 0 else 0
  
      IPTI = bypass_rate_in / bypass_rate_out if bypass_rate_out > 0 else float('inf')
      return IPTI
  ```

  

- **Alert Threshold:** `IPTI > 2.0` (Bypass rate for in-group requests is twice that of out-group requests).

**3. Digital Data Sources (Algorithm Input):**

- **HR Database API:** To determine group memberships (department, team, location). Fields: `user_id`, `department_id`, `team_id`.
- **Access Request Logs (ServiceNow, Jira, custom IAM):** To get a record of requests and their approval status. Fields: `requester`, `grantor`, `approval_status`, `timestamp`, `policy_exception_flag`.
- **Access Logs (as above):** To infer bypasses not captured in request logs.

**4. Human-to-Human Audit Protocol:**
Present auditors with a series of hypothetical access request scenarios from "in-group" and "out-group" requesters. Measure the difference in the perceived legitimacy of the request and the likelihood of granting it. Alternatively, analyze historical access approval tickets for correlation between grantor/requester department and the speed of approval.

**5. Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

- **Technical/Digital Mitigation:** Implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) where possible, automating decisions based on user attributes and resource sensitivity, removing human in-group bias from the equation.
- **Human/Organizational Mitigation:** Conduct training on in-group bias, making teams aware of the tendency and encouraging them to apply the same security standards to everyone, regardless of affiliation.
- **Process Mitigation:** Blind the grantor to certain requester attributes (like department) during the approval process for certain low-risk requests, forcing a focus on the request's merit.
