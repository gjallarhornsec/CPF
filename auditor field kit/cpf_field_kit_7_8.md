## Cortisol-Impaired Memory Assessment

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES if condition is present:**

‚ñ° **1. Procedure Consultation Increase**  
   During last 3 major incidents, teams frequently consulted written procedures for normally memorized tasks

‚ñ° **2. Training Performance Degradation**  
   Staff perform significantly worse in high-pressure simulations compared to classroom training

‚ñ° **3. Authentication Policy Violations**  
   Password sharing, MFA bypasses, or shortcuts increase during busy/crisis periods

‚ñ° **4. Documentation Dependency**  
   Experienced security staff heavily rely on written procedures when under organizational pressure

‚ñ° **5. Stress-Period Security Errors**  
   Basic security mistakes increase during budget cuts, audits, deadlines, or major changes

‚ñ° **6. Knowledge Transfer Failures**  
   Significant security knowledge loss when key personnel unavailable during critical periods

‚ñ° **7. Response Time Variance**  
   Security response times significantly slower during high-stress organizational periods

**Quick Score:** RED if 5-7 YES | YELLOW if 3-4 YES | GREEN if 0-2 YES

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
‚ñ° **Incident Response Logs** - Last 6 months of major incidents  
‚ñ° **Training Records** - Simulation vs. classroom performance data  
‚ñ° **Security Policy Violations** - Authentication/access violations during stress periods  
‚ñ° **Response Time Metrics** - Normal vs. high-stress period comparisons  
‚ñ° **Staff Turnover Reports** - Security team changes and transition impacts  

### System Demonstrations
‚ñ° **"Show me incident response during last major outage"** - Walk through actual response steps  
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate your authentication process under time pressure"** - Observe shortcuts/bypasses  
‚ñ° **"Show training simulation results"** - Compare stress vs. non-stress performance metrics  

### Interview Targets
‚ñ° **SOC Manager** - Response time changes, error patterns  
‚ñ° **Security Team Lead** - Training effectiveness, knowledge transfer issues  
‚ñ° **IT Operations** - Authentication behavior changes during pressure  
‚ñ° **HR Representative** - Stress-related security incidents, personnel issues  

### System Checks
‚ñ° **Authentication Logs** - Bypass attempts during known stress periods  
‚ñ° **Training System** - Performance metrics by stress condition  
‚ñ° **Incident Management** - Response quality metrics over time  
‚ñ° **Policy Enforcement** - Automated vs. manual control effectiveness

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

```
IF Major incidents show >50% increase in procedure consultation 
   AND Training shows >30% performance drop under pressure
   AND Authentication violations increase during stress periods
   THEN ‚Üí RED (2 points)

IF Moderate procedure consultation increases
   AND Some training performance degradation
   AND Minor authentication shortcuts within policy
   THEN ‚Üí YELLOW (1 point)  

IF Minimal procedure consultation regardless of stress
   AND Consistent training performance under pressure
   AND No authentication practice changes
   THEN ‚Üí GREEN (0 points)
```

**Scoring Decision Tree:**
- **Count RED indicators:** ___/7
- **Count YELLOW indicators:** ___/7  
- **Final Score:** RED (5+ indicators) | YELLOW (3-4 indicators) | GREEN (0-2 indicators)

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
‚ñ° **Memory-Independent Controls** (Cost: Low)
   - Force MFA, automatic timeouts, policy enforcement systems
   - **Dependencies:** Existing authentication infrastructure

‚ñ° **Stress-State Protocols** (Cost: Low)  
   - Laminated procedure cards, visual reminders, simplified checklists
   - **Dependencies:** None - immediate deployment

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM TIMELINE  
‚ñ° **Buddy System** (Cost: Medium)
   - Two-person verification during high-stress periods
   - **Dependencies:** Staff availability, procedure updates

‚ñ° **Stress Recovery Intervals** (Cost: Low)
   - Mandatory breaks every 2 hours during incidents
   - **Dependencies:** Management buy-in, staffing coverage

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
‚ñ° **Context-Aware Training** (Cost: High)
   - All training conducted under realistic stress conditions  
   - **Dependencies:** Training system overhaul, simulation capabilities

‚ñ° **Pre-Stress Knowledge Activation** (Cost: Medium)
   - Knowledge reviews before anticipated stress periods
   - **Dependencies:** Stress period prediction, scheduling systems

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your last major security incident - how did your team perform compared to their training?"**

**Follow-ups:**
- "What procedures did they need to look up that they normally know?"
- "How long did response take compared to tabletop exercises?"
- "What mistakes happened that surprised you?"

### Stress Assessment
**"When your organization is under pressure - budget cuts, audits, tight deadlines - what changes in security behavior?"**

**Follow-ups:**
- "Do people take shortcuts with passwords or authentication?"
- "How do response times change during busy periods?"
- "What security mistakes increase when everyone's stressed?"

### Red Flag Indicators
‚ñ° **Defensiveness** about stress-performance relationship
‚ñ° **"That's just how security works"** attitude  
‚ñ° **No metrics** tracking performance under different conditions
‚ñ° **Blame culture** around stress-related errors
‚ñ° **Resistance** to discussing psychological factors

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
‚ùå Avoid: "Your people can't remember basic security"
‚úÖ Use: "We're assessing how organizational pressure affects security protocol adherence"

‚ùå Avoid: "Stress is making your team incompetent"  
‚úÖ Use: "High-pressure situations can impact even well-trained professionals' performance"
