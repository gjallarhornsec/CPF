# 📋 CPF INDICATOR 5.9 FIELD KIT
## COMPLEXITY-INDUCED ERRORS

---

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable condition:**

□ **YES/NO**: Primary incident response procedure requires >15 steps
□ **YES/NO**: SOC analysts monitor >7 security systems simultaneously  
□ **YES/NO**: Security teams report being "overwhelmed" monthly or more
□ **YES/NO**: Widespread unofficial workarounds exist (observed or reported)
□ **YES/NO**: Security procedures regularly abandoned during emergencies
□ **YES/NO**: Authentication requires >5 distinct steps/systems
□ **YES/NO**: No formal process exists to assess procedure complexity

**Quick Score**: 0-2 YES = Green | 3-5 YES = Yellow | 6-7 YES = Red

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Incident response playbooks** (main procedure)
- [ ] **SIEM alert volume reports** (last 3 months)
- [ ] **Help desk tickets** related to security procedure confusion
- [ ] **Training feedback** mentioning complexity issues
- [ ] **Security team meeting minutes** (recent 6 months)

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] **"Show me your incident response process"** (walk through first 10 steps)
- [ ] **"Show me a typical SOC analyst workstation"** (count active systems)
- [ ] **"Walk me through your authentication process"** (time and count steps)

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Count security dashboards** analyst must monitor simultaneously
- [ ] **Time authentication process** for standard user login
- [ ] **Count decision points** in primary incident response procedure
- [ ] **Check for unofficial documentation** (simplified procedures, cheat sheets)

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **SOC Manager**: Complexity concerns, workaround awareness
- [ ] **2-3 SOC Analysts**: Daily overwhelm experiences, shortcuts used
- [ ] **Security Team Lead**: Procedure modification history
- [ ] **Help Desk Supervisor**: Complexity-related support requests

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START**: Count total "YES" responses from Quick Assessment

**IF 0-2 YES responses:**
- **GREEN (0)**: Procedures manageable, no systematic complexity issues

**IF 3-5 YES responses:**
- Check: Do >50% of security staff report occasional overwhelm?
  - **YES**: YELLOW (1) - Some complexity concerns
  - **NO**: GREEN (0) - Minor issues

**IF 6-7 YES responses:**
- **RED (2)**: Systematic complexity-induced vulnerability

### Objective Thresholds
- **Incident Response Steps**: >15 = Red flag
- **Simultaneous Systems**: >7 = Red flag  
- **Authentication Steps**: >5 = Red flag
- **Overwhelm Reports**: Weekly+ = Red flag

## 🔧 SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Progressive Alert Reduction** (Cost: Low)
  - Reduce SIEM alerts to <50 per analyst per shift
  - Dependencies: SIEM access, rule tuning capability
  
- **Incident Response Cards** (Cost: Low)
  - Single-page cards for top 5 incident types
  - Dependencies: Procedure analysis, design time

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM IMPLEMENTATION  
- **Authentication Streamlining** (Cost: Medium)
  - Risk-based adaptive authentication
  - Dependencies: Authentication system upgrade
  
- **Security Tool Consolidation** (Cost: Medium)
  - Unified dashboards, overlapping function removal
  - Dependencies: Tool inventory, integration planning

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
- **Cognitive Load Monitoring** (Cost: High)
  - User experience analytics on security tools
  - Dependencies: Analytics platform, ongoing monitoring
  
- **Team Complexity Training** (Cost: Medium)
  - Cognitive overload recognition and management
  - Dependencies: Training development, time allocation

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Key Opening Questions
1. **"Walk me through what happens when you get a security alert during a busy period."**
2. **"How often do your security teams tell you procedures are too complex?"**
3. **"What shortcuts do your teams use that aren't in the official procedures?"**

### Follow-Up Prompts for Incomplete Answers
- **If they say "rarely" to complexity concerns**: *"Can you show me your help desk tickets for security-related confusion?"*
- **If they deny workarounds exist**: *"How do new employees typically simplify procedures during training?"*
- **If they claim procedures are simple**: *"Can you time how long your incident response takes from start to finish?"*

### Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation
- **Defensive responses** about procedure complexity
- **Inability to demonstrate** key security procedures
- **Visible frustration** when discussing security tools
- **Frequent mentions** of "we used to do it differently"
- **Multiple people** mentioning the same workarounds

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of**: "Your procedures are too complex"
- **Say**: "We're evaluating optimization opportunities for security efficiency"

- **Instead of**: "Your team is making errors"  
- **Say**: "We're assessing alignment between procedures and operational reality"
