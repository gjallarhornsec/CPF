# 📋 INDICATOR 5.8 FIELD KIT: ATTENTION RESIDUE EFFECTS

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Binary Assessment Questions** - Check Yes/No for each:

□ **Task Switch Control**: Do written procedures limit analysts to <5 task switches per hour? _(Yes/No)_

□ **Transition Protocols**: Are mandatory "mental reset" procedures (2-3 minutes) documented between security domains? _(Yes/No)_

□ **Investigation Completion**: Do >80% of security investigations get completed by the original analyst? _(Yes/No)_

□ **Interruption Protection**: Are analysts protected from non-critical alerts during complex investigations? _(Yes/No)_

□ **Handoff Documentation**: Do shift changes include structured cognitive state transfer procedures? _(Yes/No)_

□ **Tool Integration**: Do analysts use <5 different security interfaces during peak hour periods? _(Yes/No)_

□ **Focus Time Blocks**: Are dedicated uninterrupted analysis periods (>1 hour) scheduled daily? _(Yes/No)_

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Required Documents
- [ ] **SOC procedures** for task switching and analyst workflows
- [ ] **Shift handoff templates** from past 30 days
- [ ] **Investigation completion reports** showing original vs transferred analysts
- [ ] **Tool access logs** showing application switching frequency
- [ ] **Interruption policies** protecting analyst focus time

### Demonstration Requests
- [ ] **"Show me yesterday's analyst workflow"** - specific example of tool switches
- [ ] **"Walk me through your handoff process"** - actual shift change procedure  
- [ ] **"Demonstrate urgent alert handling"** - how interruptions are managed
- [ ] **"Show tool switching during peak alerts"** - live workflow observation

### System Checks
- [ ] **Count active security tools** accessed per analyst per hour
- [ ] **Review application switching logs** for past week
- [ ] **Check investigation case status** - completion rates by original analyst
- [ ] **Examine alert queue management** during high-volume periods

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **SOC Manager** - policies and procedures
- [ ] **Tier 1 Analysts** (2-3) - daily workflow reality
- [ ] **Shift Supervisors** - interruption management practices
- [ ] **Senior Analysts** - investigation handoff experiences

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree Format

**START HERE** ↓

**Question 1**: Are investigation completion rates >80%?
- **YES** → Go to Question 2
- **NO** → **RED SCORE (2)**

**Question 2**: Do analysts switch between <5 activities per hour?
- **YES** → Go to Question 3  
- **NO** → **YELLOW SCORE (1)**

**Question 3**: Are transition protocols documented AND enforced?
- **YES** → **GREEN SCORE (0)**
- **NO** → **YELLOW SCORE (1)**

### Quick Reference Thresholds
- **GREEN (0)**: <5 switches/hour + >80% completion + documented protocols
- **YELLOW (1)**: 5-10 switches/hour + 60-79% completion + basic procedures
- **RED (2)**: >10 switches/hour + <60% completion + no controls

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your busiest security alert period last week..."**
- Follow-up: *"How many different tools did analysts use during that time?"*
- Red flag: More than 8-10 tools mentioned

**"Walk me through what happens when urgent alerts interrupt ongoing investigations..."**
- Follow-up: *"How often does this cause investigations to be abandoned?"*
- Red flag: "Happens constantly" or "Most investigations get interrupted"

**"How do you handle shift changes during active security incidents?"**
- Follow-up: *"Show me your handoff documentation from yesterday..."*
- Red flag: No formal handoff process or missing documentation

### Deeper Investigation Triggers
**If you hear:**
- "Our analysts are great multitaskers" → **Probe for actual completion rates**
- "We handle everything in real-time" → **Ask about investigation quality metrics**
- "Interruptions are just part of the job" → **Request specific examples and impact data**
- "We use the best tools available" → **Count actual tools and interfaces**

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- Instead of: *"Your analysts have cognitive problems"*
- Say: *"Let's optimize your workflow efficiency and investigation quality"*

- Instead of: *"You're missing threats due to attention issues"*  
- Say: *"We can improve detection accuracy by reducing task switching overhead"*
