## Stress-Induced Tunnel Vision Assessment

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Instructions**: Check YES/NO for each question based on observable evidence only.

‚ñ° **Q1**: Does organization have documented procedures for parallel alert investigation during high-stress periods?  
   ‚òê YES - Written procedures exist and show evidence of recent use  
   ‚òê NO - No procedures or no evidence of use in last 6 months

‚ñ° **Q2**: Are there formal requirements for cross-team consultation during complex security events?  
   ‚òê YES - Mandatory consultation with network/application/compliance teams documented  
   ‚òê NO - No formal requirements or consultation is optional

‚ñ° **Q3**: Does routine security monitoring continue during active incident response?  
   ‚òê YES - Staffing plans show dedicated "business as usual" teams during incidents  
   ‚òê NO - All staff reassigned to incidents or no dedicated monitoring coverage

‚ñ° **Q4**: Is there a documented decision validation process for urgent security actions?  
   ‚òê YES - Two-person approval required for critical actions (shutdown, access revocation)  
   ‚òê NO - Single-person decisions allowed or process easily bypassed

‚ñ° **Q5**: Are there mandatory pause protocols during extended incident response?  
   ‚òê YES - Required team huddles every 2 hours during incidents >4 hours  
   ‚òê NO - No structured pause protocols or informal only

‚ñ° **Q6**: Do post-incident reviews regularly discover missed indicators?  
   ‚òê YES - <20% of incidents result in additional findings post-resolution  
   ‚òê NO - >20% of incidents result in additional findings post-resolution

‚ñ° **Q7**: Are there formal scope assessment protocols for determining multi-vector attacks?  
   ‚òê YES - Documented checklists with specific multi-vector verification steps  
   ‚òê NO - No formal protocols or single-threat assumptions standard

**Quick Score**: Count YES answers  
- 6-7 YES = Green (Low Risk)
- 4-5 YES = Yellow (Moderate Risk)  
- 0-3 YES = Red (High Risk)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree**

**START HERE** ‚Üí Are documented procedures present for parallel investigation?

**NO** ‚Üí **RED SCORE** (High Vulnerability)

**YES** ‚Üí Are procedures actually used (evidence in last 6 months)?

**NO** ‚Üí **RED SCORE** (High Vulnerability)

**YES** ‚Üí Does routine monitoring continue during 90%+ of incidents?

**NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW SCORE** (Moderate Vulnerability)

**YES** ‚Üí Do post-incident reviews find missed indicators in <20% of cases?

**NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW SCORE** (Moderate Vulnerability)

**YES** ‚Üí **GREEN SCORE** (Low Vulnerability)

### **Objective Thresholds**
- **GREEN**: 6-7 controls present + evidence of consistent use
- **YELLOW**: 4-5 controls present + inconsistent application
- **RED**: 0-3 controls present + no evidence of systematic approach

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### **HIGH IMPACT - Quick Implementation**
‚ñ° **Incident Response Decision Trees** (Cost: Low, Time: 2-4 weeks)  
   - Mandatory checkpoints for multi-vector consideration
   - Prevents single-threat tunnel vision immediately

‚ñ° **Stress Circuit Breakers** (Cost: Low, Time: 1-2 weeks)  
   - 15-minute huddles every 2 hours during extended incidents
   - Immediate awareness and scope reassessment

### **HIGH IMPACT - Long-term Implementation**  
‚ñ° **Parallel Investigation Teams** (Cost: Medium, Time: 2-3 months)  
   - Dedicated "business as usual" monitoring staff
   - Requires staffing model changes

‚ñ° **Cross-Functional Review Panels** (Cost: Medium, Time: 1-2 months)  
   - Mandatory consultation with other teams
   - Requires process integration across departments

### **MEDIUM IMPACT - Quick Implementation**
‚ñ° **Post-Incident Red Team Reviews** (Cost: Low, Time: 2-3 weeks)  
   - Structured 48-hour review process
   - External perspective requirement

### **Dependencies**
- **Budget approval** required for: Additional staffing, external consultants
- **Executive support** required for: Cross-team consultation requirements
- **Technology integration** needed for: Automated scope assessment tools

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions**
**"Tell me about your last major security incident. How did you allocate your team's time between investigating the obvious symptoms versus comprehensive threat hunting?"**

**Follow-up**: *Look for >40% time on comprehensive analysis (Green) vs <20% (Red)*

### **Pressure Testing**
**"When you receive multiple critical alerts simultaneously, what's your standard procedure? Can you give me a recent example with 5+ alerts in 2 hours?"**

**Follow-up**: *Look for documented procedures vs ad-hoc responses*

### **Cross-Team Dynamics**
**"How often do your security analysts consult with network, application, or compliance teams during high-stress investigations?"**

**Red flags**: *"We handle it internally," "No time for meetings during incidents"*

### **Decision Quality**
**"What's your process for double-checking urgent security decisions like system shutdowns or access revocations?"**

**Red flags**: *"We trust our experts," "No time for validation during emergencies"*

### **Scope Assessment**
**"How do you determine if a security incident might be part of a larger, coordinated attack rather than isolated?"**

**Red flags**: *"We focus on what's in front of us," "Usually just one threat at a time"*
