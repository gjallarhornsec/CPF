## ACUTE STRESS IMPAIRMENT

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each:**

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Do security incidents regularly require decisions within 15 minutes?

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Has the organization experienced 3+ simultaneous security alerts in the past 6 months?

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Can individuals bypass normal approval processes during "emergency" security situations?

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Have security decisions been made when primary staff were unavailable (after hours/vacation)?

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Have external stakeholders (executives/customers) pressured security teams during active incidents?

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Do security staff regularly work overtime/extended shifts during incidents?

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Are stress management protocols absent from incident response procedures?

**Quick Count:** ___/7 YES answers = Initial Risk Level

---

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
‚ñ° **Incident response playbooks** (look for stress management sections)
‚ñ° **Recent incident reports** (last 6 months - check response times/decisions)
‚ñ° **Emergency authority procedures** (who can bypass what)
‚ñ° **Staff scheduling records** during recent incidents
‚ñ° **Training records** for stress/incident response

### Demonstrations to Request:
‚ñ° **"Show me your incident escalation process"** (time each step)
‚ñ° **"Walk through your emergency contact procedures"**
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate how you handle multiple simultaneous alerts"**

### System Checks:
‚ñ° **Alert frequency settings** (how often do urgent alerts occur?)
‚ñ° **Incident management tools** (built-in stress circuit breakers?)
‚ñ° **Emergency override capabilities** (who has access?)

### Interview Targets:
‚ñ° **SOC analysts** (front-line stress exposure)
‚ñ° **Incident response team lead** (decision-making under pressure)
‚ñ° **Security manager** (oversight during crisis)
‚ñ° **IT operations staff** (coordination during incidents)

---

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**If 0-2 YES answers:**
‚Üí **GREEN (0)** - Low acute stress risk

**If 3-4 YES answers:**
‚Üí **YELLOW (1)** - Moderate acute stress risk

**If 5-7 YES answers:**
‚Üí **RED (2)** - High acute stress risk

### Override Criteria (Force RED regardless of count):
‚ñ° **No documented stress protocols** in incident response
‚ñ° **Emergency authority undefined** or frequently bypassed
‚ñ° **No backup staffing** for security functions
‚ñ° **Regular 12+ hour shifts** during incidents

**Final Score:** ‚ñ° GREEN (0) ‚ñ° YELLOW (1) ‚ñ° RED (2)

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
‚ñ° **Incident Response Checklists** (Cost: Low, Time: 2 weeks)
   - Mandatory steps that cannot be bypassed
   - Clear decision trees for common scenarios

‚ñ° **10-Minute Circuit Breakers** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)
   - Forced cooling-off periods before major decisions
   - Built into incident management systems

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
‚ñ° **Stress Simulation Training** (Cost: Medium, Time: 3 months)
   - Monthly tabletop exercises with time pressure
   - Protocol adherence under stress measurement

‚ñ° **Rotation Protocols** (Cost: Medium, Time: 2 months)
   - Mandatory staff rotation during extended incidents
   - Cross-training backup personnel

### MEDIUM IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
‚ñ° **Decision Support Tools** (Cost: Medium, Time: 6 weeks)
   - Automated guidance during incidents
   - Real-time access to approved procedures

‚ñ° **Executive Communication Buffer** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)
   - Shield technical teams from direct pressure
   - Scheduled briefings vs. constant interruptions

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Tell me about your most stressful security incident in the last year."**

**"How do you ensure good decisions when everyone's under pressure?"**

### Follow-up Prompts:
- **If they mention time pressure:** *"What's the fastest security decision you've had to make? How did you ensure it was right?"*

- **If they mention multiple alerts:** *"Walk me through what happens when several alarms go off at once."*

- **If they mention executive pressure:** *"How do you balance business pressure with security best practices during an incident?"*

### Red Flag Indicators:
‚ñ° **"We just have to make quick decisions"** (no structured process)
‚ñ° **"Everyone knows what to do"** (no documented procedures)
‚ñ° **"Our team can handle the pressure"** (dismissing stress impact)
‚ñ° **"Executives need immediate answers"** (no communication buffer)

### Professional Phrasing for Sensitive Topics:
- Instead of *"stress impairment"* ‚Üí **"decision quality under pressure"**
- Instead of *"psychological vulnerability"* ‚Üí **"human factors in security"**
- Instead of *"acute stress"* ‚Üí **"high-pressure situations"**
