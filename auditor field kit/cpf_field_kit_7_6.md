## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE** ‚Üí Count YES answers from Quick Assessment

**0-2 YES answers** ‚Üí **GREEN (Strong Boundaries)**
- Proceed to verify with evidence
- If evidence contradicts, move to YELLOW

**3-4 YES answers** ‚Üí **YELLOW (Inconsistent Enforcement)**
- Check for formal exception processes
- If processes exist but bypassed ‚Üí RED
- If processes work effectively ‚Üí stay YELLOW

**5-7 YES answers** ‚Üí **RED (Systematic Accommodation)**
- Immediate high-risk classification
- Focus on urgent solution implementation

### Verification Criteria
- **GREEN**: Formal processes exist AND are followed consistently
- **YELLOW**: Processes exist but with regular informal bypasses
- **RED**: No effective processes OR systematic circumvention

**Final Score**: ‚òê GREEN ‚òê YELLOW ‚òê RED

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Let's talk about how security decisions get made in practice..."**

- *"When someone needs access they don't normally have, what typically happens?"*
- *"Can you think of a recent time when security policy was bent to help someone out?"*
- *"How comfortable do your staff feel saying 'no' to access requests?"*

### Follow-up Probes
**If they mention exceptions or workarounds:**
- *"How often would you say this happens? Weekly? Monthly?"*
- *"Who usually makes these decisions?"*
- *"What happens if the person asking seems frustrated or upset?"*

**If they deny problems:**
- *"Have there been any situations where VIPs or executives needed urgent access?"*
- *"Do you have any reports of password sharing or account sharing?"*
- *"How do employees escalate when they're unsure about access requests?"*

### Red Flag Indicators
- [ ] **Defensive responses** about "necessary flexibility"
- [ ] **Examples of recent bypasses** described as normal
- [ ] **Mentions of staff anxiety** about security enforcement
- [ ] **"Special cases"** for executives or important clients
- [ ] **Lack of formal exception processes**

### Professional Positioning
*"This is about building systems that support your staff in making good security decisions even under pressure. Many organizations struggle with this balance."*
