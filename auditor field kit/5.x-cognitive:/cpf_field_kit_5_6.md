# üìã CPF INDICATOR 5.6 FIELD KIT: COGNITIVE TUNNELING

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization has documented procedures requiring attention rotation during incidents lasting >2 hours

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: SIEM/security tools have active correlation rules flagging simultaneous alerts across different security domains (network + endpoint + email, etc.)

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security team uses buddy system or paired monitoring during high-priority incidents

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Formal approval process exists for bypassing security controls during urgent operations

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization can show evidence of successfully detecting multi-vector attacks in past 12 months

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Training records show cognitive tunneling awareness training conducted within past 24 months

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Automated monitoring systems continue background scanning when human teams focus on specific incidents

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### **Documents to Request**
- [ ] Incident response procedures (look for attention management requirements)
- [ ] SIEM correlation rules configuration
- [ ] Security override/exception approval logs from past 90 days
- [ ] Training records for security team (past 24 months)
- [ ] Post-incident reports from past 12 months (check for multi-vector mentions)

### **System Demonstrations**
- [ ] "Show me your SIEM dashboard during a simulated high-priority alert"
- [ ] "Walk through your incident response process for a network intrusion"
- [ ] "Demonstrate how alerts from different security tools get correlated"
- [ ] "Show me how temporary security exceptions get approved and restored"

### **Key Interview Targets**
- [ ] **SOC Manager/Lead**: Daily operations and team coordination
- [ ] **Senior SOC Analyst**: Real incident experiences and challenges
- [ ] **IT Operations Manager**: Security control bypass procedures
- [ ] **CISO/Security Director**: Training programs and policies

### **System Checks**
- [ ] Review alert volume and correlation rates in SIEM for past 30 days
- [ ] Check for automated background monitoring configurations
- [ ] Verify security exception logs show approval workflows
- [ ] Examine incident response team size and rotation schedules

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree**

**START HERE** ‚Üí Does organization have documented attention rotation procedures + SIEM correlation rules + buddy system?

**‚Üì YES** ‚Üí Can they show evidence of detecting multi-vector attacks + formal security override process?
   - **YES** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**: Strong cognitive tunneling controls
   - **NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**: Partial controls, missing evidence

**‚Üì NO** ‚Üí Do they have any systematic multi-vector detection OR attention management procedures?
   - **YES** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**: Some controls but inconsistent
   - **NO** ‚Üí **RED (2)**: No systematic tunneling prevention

### **Objective Thresholds**
- **GREEN**: ‚â•5 YES answers in Quick Assessment + evidence of multi-vector detection
- **YELLOW**: 3-4 YES answers + partial evidence
- **RED**: ‚â§2 YES answers + no multi-vector detection evidence

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions**
- *"Walk me through what happens when you get a high-priority security alert while already working another incident."*
- *"Tell me about the last time you discovered an attack was more complex than it first appeared."*
- *"How do you ensure your team doesn't miss other threats when focused on urgent IT problems?"*

### **Follow-up Prompts for Incomplete Answers**
- **If they mention procedures**: *"Can you show me the documented process? When was it last used?"*
- **If they mention training**: *"What specific scenarios do you practice? How do you measure effectiveness?"*
- **If they mention tools**: *"Demonstrate how alerts from different systems get connected together."*

### **Red Flag Indicators**
- **üö©** "We handle incidents as they come" (no systematic approach)
- **üö©** "Our team is small so everyone focuses on the biggest problem" (resource-driven tunneling)
- **üö©** "We've never had a multi-vector attack" (lack of awareness/detection)
- **üö©** "During outages, security takes a back seat" (operational override culture)

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics**
- Instead of: *"Your team misses threats"*
- Say: *"Let's explore how to maintain broad awareness during intensive focus periods"*

- Instead of: *"You have blind spots"*
- Say: *"We're assessing situational awareness capabilities across multiple threat vectors"*
