# CPF FIELD KIT 5.1: Alert Fatigue Desensitization

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable condition:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security team receives >150 alerts per analyst per day
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: False positive rate exceeds 70% (or team estimates "most alerts are false")
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Average response time to alerts exceeds 4 hours
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: No formal alert tuning process exists (no documented reviews/changes)
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Analysts regularly complain about "alert noise" or "too many alerts"
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Critical security incidents were missed in past 12 months
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Analysts have disabled/suppressed alert types without formal approval

**Quick Score**: 0-2 YES = Green | 3-4 YES = Yellow | 5+ YES = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **SIEM/Alert logs** from past 30 days showing daily volumes
- [ ] **Alert resolution reports** showing disposition (false positive/actionable)
- [ ] **Incident response tickets** with timestamps (alert‚Üíinvestigation)
- [ ] **Alert tuning documentation** (configuration changes, approvals)
- [ ] **Security staffing schedule** (coverage during absences)

### System Demonstrations
- [ ] **"Show me your alert dashboard"** - observe current alert volumes
- [ ] **"Walk through investigating this alert"** - time the process
- [ ] **"Show me disabled/filtered alerts"** - identify suppressed notifications
- [ ] **"Demonstrate escalation process"** - verify coverage procedures

### Key Interviews
- [ ] **SOC Analysts** (2-3 individuals): Daily alert handling experience
- [ ] **Security Manager**: Alert management policies and procedures
- [ ] **IT Operations**: System maintenance impact on alerts
- [ ] **Recent hire**: Training on alert handling

### System Checks
- [ ] **Alert volume calculation**: Total alerts √∑ number of analysts √∑ days
- [ ] **Response time analysis**: Review timestamps in ticketing system
- [ ] **False positive rate**: (Dismissed alerts √∑ Total alerts) √ó 100

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Decision Tree - Start Here:**

**STEP 1**: Daily alerts per analyst?
- **<50**: Continue to Step 2
- **50-150**: Skip to Yellow criteria check
- **>150**: Score RED immediately

**STEP 2**: False positive rate?
- **<30%**: Continue to Step 3  
- **30-70%**: Skip to Yellow criteria check
- **>70%**: Score RED immediately

**STEP 3**: Response time consistency?
- **<30 min average**: Continue to Step 4
- **30min-4hr variable**: Yellow criteria check
- **>4hr frequent**: Score RED immediately

**STEP 4**: Formal processes exist?
- **Yes + documented**: Score GREEN
- **Informal only**: Score YELLOW
- **None**: Score RED

**Yellow Criteria Check** (need 2+ for Yellow, otherwise Green):
- ‚ñ° Inconsistent response times
- ‚ñ° Some missed incidents
- ‚ñ° Informal alert management
- ‚ñ° Occasional complaints

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"How many security alerts does your team see on a typical day?"**
- *Follow-up*: "How many require actual action?"
- *Red flag*: Vague answers or "too many to count"

**"Tell me about a recent security incident you missed or detected late."**
- *Follow-up*: "Were there alerts that should have caught it?"
- *Red flag*: Multiple incidents or dismissive attitude

**"What happens when your security analyst calls in sick?"**
- *Follow-up*: "How do you ensure alert coverage?"
- *Red flag*: No backup plan or single points of failure

### Sensitive Topics
**Instead of**: "Do your analysts ignore alerts?"
**Say**: "How does your team prioritize which alerts to investigate first?"

**Instead of**: "Are your security tools poorly configured?"
**Say**: "How often do you review and tune your alert thresholds?"

**Instead of**: "Do you have alert fatigue problems?"
**Say**: "How do you measure the effectiveness of your security alerts?"

### Red Flag Responses
- [ ] **"We get so many alerts we can't keep up"**
- [ ] **"Most of our alerts are false positives"**
- [ ] **"We've had to turn off some monitoring because of noise"**
- [ ] **"Our analysts complain about alert overload"**
- [ ] **"We missed [incident] because it got lost in all the alerts"**
