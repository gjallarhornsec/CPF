# üìã INDICATOR 5.2 FIELD KIT: Decision Fatigue Errors

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security team processes **more than 50 decisions** per 8-hour shift
  - *Evidence: Alert logs, ticket counts, workflow reports*

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: **No documented procedures** exist for high-volume decision periods  
  - *Evidence: Policy documents, workflow manuals*

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security decisions are **concentrated in 1-2 people** (no rotation/distribution)
  - *Evidence: Approval logs, decision maker assignments*

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: **No automation** handles routine security decisions (alerts, access, exceptions)
  - *Evidence: Tool configurations, automation rules*

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Team reports **decision overload** during peak periods
  - *Evidence: Survey results, interview responses, overtime records*

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: **No secondary approval** required for decisions made after 3 PM or Fridays
  - *Evidence: Approval workflows, policy requirements*

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: **No decision load monitoring** system tracks individual/team capacity
  - *Evidence: Dashboard existence, workload metrics*

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### **Documents to Request:**
- [ ] **Security alert logs** (last 30 days) - count decisions per person per day
- [ ] **Access request approvals** - timestamps and approver names
- [ ] **Policy exception requests** - frequency and approval patterns  
- [ ] **Incident response logs** - decision points and timing
- [ ] **Team schedules** - rotation policies, workload distribution
- [ ] **Overtime reports** - security team working beyond normal hours

### **System Demonstrations:**
- [ ] **"Show me your security dashboard"** - count active alerts requiring decisions
- [ ] **"Walk through approving an access request"** - observe decision complexity
- [ ] **"Show me automated vs manual processes"** - identify decision bottlenecks
- [ ] **"Demonstrate alert triage process"** - count decision points per alert

### **Interview Targets:**
- [ ] **Security Operations Manager** - team workload and fatigue patterns
- [ ] **Security Analysts** (2-3 people) - daily decision volume and stress points
- [ ] **IT Help Desk Supervisor** - access request processing load
- [ ] **Compliance Officer** - exception approval frequency

### **System Checks:**
- [ ] **Count active security tools** requiring human decisions
- [ ] **Review automation configurations** - what's automated vs manual
- [ ] **Check alert queue sizes** during assessment
- [ ] **Verify decision tracking** capabilities in security tools

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree:**

**START HERE:** Count daily security decisions per team member

**If FEWER than 25 decisions per person per day:**
- ‚úÖ **AND** has documented high-volume procedures = **GREEN (0)**
- ‚ùå **AND** no documented procedures = **YELLOW (1)**

**If 25-50 decisions per person per day:**
- ‚úÖ **AND** has automation + backup procedures = **YELLOW (1)**  
- ‚ùå **AND** no automation or backup = **RED (2)**

**If MORE than 50 decisions per person per day:**
- **Always = RED (2)** regardless of other factors

### **Automatic RED Triggers:**
- No decision load monitoring
- No automation for routine decisions
- All security decisions go through 1-2 people
- Team reports frequent decision overload

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

| **Solution** | **Impact** | **Timeline** | **Cost** | **Dependencies** |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **Decision Load Balancing** | HIGH | 2-4 weeks | LOW | Team training, workflow changes |
| **Alert Automation Rules** | HIGH | 1-2 weeks | MEDIUM | Security tool configuration |
| **Decision Quality Checkpoints** | MEDIUM | 1 week | LOW | Policy update, team agreement |
| **Cognitive Load Management** | MEDIUM | 4-6 weeks | LOW | Process redesign, templates |
| **Emergency Decision Protocols** | HIGH | 2 weeks | LOW | Template creation, team training |
| **Workload Monitoring Dashboard** | LOW | 4-8 weeks | HIGH | New tool, integration work |

### **Quick Wins (Start Immediately):**
1. **Implement decision quotas** per team member per day
2. **Create standard decision templates** for common scenarios  
3. **Establish 4 PM decision review** requirement for critical choices
4. **Batch similar decisions** into dedicated time blocks

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions:**
- *"How many security alerts does your team handle in a typical day?"*
- *"What time of day do you see the most security decisions pile up?"*
- *"When was the last time your security team felt overwhelmed by decision volume?"*

### **Follow-up Prompts:**
- **If they say "not many decisions":** *"Let's count together - alerts, access requests, policy exceptions, incident classifications..."*
- **If they say "we handle it fine":** *"Can you show me your decision logs from last Friday afternoon?"*
- **If they mention automation:** *"What percentage of decisions are fully automated vs requiring human review?"*

### **Red Flag Indicators (Investigate Deeper):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"We bulk-dismiss alerts sometimes"** ‚Üí Alert fatigue present
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Friday afternoons are crazy"** ‚Üí Peak fatigue periods identified  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Our senior analyst handles all the complex stuff"** ‚Üí Single point of failure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"We approve exceptions to keep things moving"** ‚Üí Quality degradation

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:**
- Instead of *"Your team makes bad decisions"* ‚Üí *"Let's optimize decision-making efficiency"*
- Instead of *"Decision fatigue is dangerous"* ‚Üí *"We can reduce cognitive load on your team"*
- Instead of *"This is a major risk"* ‚Üí *"There's opportunity to strengthen your security posture"*
