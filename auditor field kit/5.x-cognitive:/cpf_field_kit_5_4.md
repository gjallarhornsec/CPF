## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
‚ñ° **Security team job descriptions** (roles and responsibilities)  
‚ñ° **Shift schedules and coverage models**  
‚ñ° **Alert response procedures** (priority/escalation matrix)  
‚ñ° **Security tool inventory** and integration diagram  
‚ñ° **Recent incident response reports** (last 3 months)  
‚ñ° **Performance metrics dashboards** for security operations  

### Demonstrations to Request:
‚ñ° **"Show me a typical analyst workstation during normal operations"**  
‚ñ° **"Walk through how you handle multiple simultaneous alerts"**  
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate your alert prioritization process"**  
‚ñ° **"Show coverage during off-hours/weekend monitoring"**  

### System Checks to Perform:
‚ñ° Count active security dashboards/tools requiring separate interfaces  
‚ñ° Review alert volumes and frequency patterns (last 30 days)  
‚ñ° Check integration status between security platforms  
‚ñ° Verify automated alert filtering/correlation capabilities  

### Interview Targets:
‚ñ° **SOC Manager/Security Lead** (operational oversight)  
‚ñ° **Security Analysts** (daily operations, at least 2 different shifts)  
‚ñ° **IT Manager** (resource allocation and competing priorities)  
‚ñ° **Incident Response Team Lead** (multi-incident scenarios)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Decision Tree - Answer in sequence:**

### Step 1: Check Integration
- **If Q5 = Integrated AND automated alert correlation exists** ‚Üí Continue to Step 2
- **If Q5 = Separate Applications OR no alert correlation** ‚Üí **RED (2)**

### Step 2: Check Staffing/Coverage  
- **If Q4 = No (adequate coverage) AND protected time blocks exist** ‚Üí Continue to Step 3
- **If Q4 = Yes (solo shifts) OR no protected time** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

### Step 3: Check Procedures/Metrics
- **If Q3 = Yes AND Q6 = Yes AND minimal non-security interruptions** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**
- **If Q3 = No OR Q6 = No OR frequent interruptions** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

### Override Conditions (regardless of above):
- **If 5+ separate security tools require active monitoring** ‚Üí **RED (2)**
- **If no documented alert triage procedures exist** ‚Üí **RED (2)**
- **If security staff report frequent task-switching** ‚Üí Upgrade by 1 level (Green‚ÜíYellow, Yellow‚ÜíRed)

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Can you walk me through what happens during a typical busy period for your security team?"**  
*Follow-up*: "How many different screens or tools are they looking at simultaneously?"

**"When you get multiple security alerts at the same time, what's the process?"**  
*Red Flag*: No clear process, or "whoever's available handles whatever comes in"

**"How do you ensure security monitoring continues during nights, weekends, or when key staff are out?"**  
*Red Flag*: Single points of failure, cross-training gaps

### Probing Questions:
**"Tell me about a recent time when your team was managing multiple security issues simultaneously."**  
*Listen for*: Missed indicators, delayed responses, coordination problems

**"What non-security tasks do your security analysts handle during their shifts?"**  
*Red Flag*: User support, system admin, meetings during active monitoring

**"How do you measure whether your security team is being effective when they're busy?"**  
*Red Flag*: No metrics, subjective assessments only

### Sensitive Topics (Use Professional Language):
- **Instead of**: "Your team is cognitively overloaded"  
- **Say**: "We want to ensure your team can maintain focus on critical threats"

- **Instead of**: "Multitasking is degrading performance"  
- **Say**: "Let's optimize your team's attention on high-priority security events"
