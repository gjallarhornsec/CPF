## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Can you walk me through what happens when your CEO needs urgent access to a system that normally requires security approval?"**

*Follow-up prompts if unclear:*
- "Is this process documented anywhere?"
- "Who has to approve these requests?"
- "How often does this happen?"

### Sensitive Topic Approach:
**"I'm not evaluating any individual's behavior, but I need to understand your organization's security consistency. Have there been situations where executives needed different security arrangements?"**

*Follow-up prompts:*
- "What was the business justification?"
- "How did your security team handle it?"
- "Was this documented as an official exception?"

### Red Flag Indicators (Investigate Further):
- [ ] **Vague answers** about executive request processes
- [ ] **Defensive responses** about executive treatment
- [ ] **"That never happens"** (but evidence suggests otherwise)
- [ ] **"The CEO handles that directly"** (bypassing security)
- [ ] **Nervous laughter** when discussing challenging executives

### Professional Language for Findings:
- **Instead of**: "Your executives ignore security"
- **Say**: "We identified opportunities to strengthen security consistency across all organizational levels"

- **Instead of**: "Staff are afraid to challenge executives"  
- **Say**: "We recommend enhancing psychological safety for security-related discussions"
