## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable condition:**

□ **YES/NO**: Organization has documented anonymous security reporting system  
□ **YES/NO**: Senior executives follow same security policies as general staff (no special exceptions)  
□ **YES/NO**: Security team reports directly to board/audit committee (independent escalation path)  
□ **YES/NO**: Organization tracks executive security compliance with regular reporting

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request

- [ ] **Executive security compliance reports** (last 6 months)
- [ ] **Security escalation procedures** (org chart showing reporting lines)
- [ ] **Security meeting minutes** (last 3 months, mixed hierarchy meetings)
- [ ] **Executive security exception log** (any special accommodations granted)

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] **"Show me your anonymous reporting system"** (walk through submission process)
- [ ] **"Show me executive monitoring dashboard"** (compliance tracking, access logs)
- [ ] **"Show me escalation procedure"** (how to report executive-related security issues)

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Anonymous reporting functionality** (test submission without completing)
- [ ] **Executive access logs** (verify monitoring capabilities exist)
- [ ] **Security policy compliance tracking** (executive vs. general population)

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **Security team lead** (comfort reporting upward, executive responses)

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here**: Does organization have anonymous reporting system?
- **NO** → Automatic RED
- **YES** → Continue

**Next**: Do executives follow same security policies as others?
- **NO** → RED (unless documented exception process exists)
- **YES** → Continue

**Next**: Does security team have independent escalation path to board?
- **NO** → Maximum YELLOW
- **YES** → Continue

**Final**: Evidence of security concerns raised about executives in last 12 months?
- **NO** → YELLOW (may indicate reporting suppression)
- **YES with positive response** → GREEN
- **YES with negative consequences** → RED

### Objective Thresholds
- **Anonymous reporting >40% of total incidents** = RED flag
- **Zero executive-related security reports in 12 months** = RED flag  
- **Executive compliance <80% of organizational average** = RED flag
- **No junior staff participation in security meetings** = YELLOW flag

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Walk me through what happens when someone discovers a security issue involving a senior executive or their preferred system."**

**Follow-up if unclear**: *"Can you give me a specific recent example?"*

**"How comfortable would a junior employee feel reporting a security concern about their manager?"**

**Follow-up if deflected**: *"What protections exist against negative consequences?"*

**"Show me your anonymous reporting statistics - what percentage comes through anonymous vs. direct channels?"**

**Follow-up**: *"What types of issues typically come through anonymous reporting?"*

### Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation
- **Defensive responses** about executive security practices
- **"We don't have those problems here"** without supporting evidence  
- **Inability to provide recent examples** of upward security reporting
- **Reluctance to demonstrate anonymous reporting system**
- **Vague policies** without specific protection mechanisms
- **No knowledge of reporting statistics** or patterns

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- Use: **"Authority gradient effects"** instead of "executives ignore security"
- Use: **"Organizational reporting patterns"** instead of "people are afraid"  
- Use: **"Hierarchical communication challenges"** instead of "power problems"
- Use: **"Cross-level security coordination"** instead of "junior staff won't speak up"
