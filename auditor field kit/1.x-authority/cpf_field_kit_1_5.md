## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Multi-person authorization procedures** (financial, access, data)
- [ ] **Emergency override logs** from past 90 days
- [ ] **Security awareness training materials** with authority scenarios
- [ ] **Escalation policies** and retaliation protection procedures
- [ ] **Recent high-value transaction approvals** (sample 5-10)

### Demonstrations Needed

- [ ] **"Show me"**: How IT handles emergency access requests
- [ ] **"Show me"**: Your verification process for compliance demands
- [ ] **"Walk through"**: Recent emergency override example

### System Checks
- [ ] **Test dual approval controls** - can single person authorize high-risk action?
- [ ] **Review notification systems** - do high-risk requests alert security?
- [ ] **Check override documentation** - are bypasses properly logged?
- [ ] **Verify escalation paths** - do they bypass direct reporting lines?

### Interview Targets

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here**: Does organization have formal dual approval for high-risk requests?

**IF NO** → **RED** (High Vulnerability)

**IF YES** → Can dual approval be overridden by single authority?

   **IF YES** → **RED** (High Vulnerability)
   
   **IF NO** → How often are emergency overrides used?
   
      **IF >15%** → **RED** (High Vulnerability)
      **IF 5-15%** → **YELLOW** (Moderate Vulnerability)
      **IF <5%** → Are employees protected when questioning authority?
      
         **IF NO** → **YELLOW** (Moderate Vulnerability)
         **IF YES** → **GREEN** (Low Vulnerability)

### Objective Criteria
- **Emergency Override Rate**: Count overrides ÷ total requests × 100
- **Verification Examples**: Must have 2+ examples in past 6 months
- **Training Frequency**: Authority scenarios covered in past 12 months
- **Protection Evidence**: Written policy + no retaliation incidents
