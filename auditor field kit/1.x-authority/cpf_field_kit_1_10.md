# üìã INDICATOR 1.10 FIELD KIT: Crisis Authority Escalation

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Complete all 7 questions with Yes/No responses:**

‚ñ° **Q1**: Does the organization have documented emergency procedures that require multi-person verification for elevated access? *(Check emergency response documentation)*

‚ñ° **Q2**: Are there secure, authenticated communication channels specifically designated for crisis communications? *(Observe crisis communication systems)*

‚ñ° **Q3**: Has the organization conducted crisis simulation training that includes authority verification scenarios in the past 12 months? *(Review training records)*

‚ñ° **Q4**: Do "break glass" emergency access procedures require documented approval before granting privileges? *(Examine access control logs)*

‚ñ° **Q5**: Are employees required to verify identity regardless of claimed authority level during emergencies? *(Check policy documents)*

‚ñ° **Q6**: Is break glass access used less than monthly with full documentation? *(Review access frequency logs)*

‚ñ° **Q7**: Do crisis response procedures include specific contact numbers/methods for verifying authority claims? *(Review crisis response plans)*

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] **Emergency access procedures** (last 12 months)
- [ ] **Crisis simulation exercise reports** (most recent)
- [ ] **Break glass access logs** (past 6 months)
- [ ] **Crisis communication protocols**
- [ ] **Authority verification training materials**

### Demonstrations to Request:
- [ ] **"Show me your crisis communication system"**
- [ ] **"Walk through your emergency access approval process"**
- [ ] **"Demonstrate how someone verifies authority during an emergency"**

### System Checks:
- [ ] **Break glass access monitoring alerts** (verify operational)
- [ ] **Multi-factor authentication on crisis channels** (test if possible)
- [ ] **Emergency access approval workflows** (review configuration)

### Interview Targets:
- [ ] **IT Operations Manager** (break glass procedures)
- [ ] **Security Team Lead** (crisis response protocols)
- [ ] **HR Training Coordinator** (crisis training programs)
- [ ] **2-3 General Staff** (authority verification knowledge)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Follow decision tree sequentially:**

### Step 1: Count "Yes" responses from Quick Assessment
- **6-7 Yes answers** ‚Üí Proceed to Step 2
- **4-5 Yes answers** ‚Üí **YELLOW** (Moderate Vulnerability)
- **0-3 Yes answers** ‚Üí **RED** (High Vulnerability)

### Step 2: Check Critical Controls (only if 6-7 Yes answers)
**All must be present for GREEN:**
- [ ] Multi-person authorization required for ALL emergency access
- [ ] Crisis training conducted within 6 months (not 12)
- [ ] Break glass access used quarterly or less
- [ ] Secure communication channels with authentication

**If any missing** ‚Üí **YELLOW** (Moderate Vulnerability)
**If all present** ‚Üí **GREEN** (Low Vulnerability)

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Can you walk me through what happens when someone claiming to be senior leadership requests emergency system access during an outage?"**

*Follow-up prompts:*
- "Who approves these requests?"
- "How do you verify their identity?"
- "Can you show me the last time this happened?"

### Red Flag Follow-ups:
**If they mention bypassing normal procedures:**
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What's the approval process for bypassing security?"
- "Who has authority to grant these exceptions?"

### Authority Verification Probe:
**"What happens if someone from outside your department requests urgent access during an emergency?"**

*Listen for:*
- Automatic compliance without verification
- "We don't question authority during emergencies"
- Lack of clear verification procedures

### Crisis Training Assessment:
**"Tell me about your most recent crisis simulation or emergency drill."**

*Follow-up prompts:*
- "Did it include authority verification scenarios?"
- "How did employees perform under pressure?"
- "What security procedures were maintained?"
