# üìã CPF FIELD KIT 1.9: Authority-Based Social Proof

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable condition:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Executive requests routinely bypass normal approval workflows
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: When one team gets security exception approval, others request similar exceptions within 30 days
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Employees reference "what others are doing" when justifying security decisions
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: New employee security training relies primarily on peer guidance rather than formal procedures
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Policy exceptions become "standard practice" without formal policy updates
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Verification steps are skipped when requests have both executive backing AND reference group behavior
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Recent security incidents involved multiple employees making same poor decision after seeing colleagues do it first

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions:**
1. *"Can you walk me through what happens when a senior executive needs something done urgently?"*
2. *"When one department gets approval for new access, do other departments typically ask for the same thing?"*
3. *"How do new employees learn what security practices are actually followed here?"*

### **Follow-up Prompts:**
- **If they mention bypassing procedures**: *"Can you give me a recent specific example?"*
- **If they reference peer behavior**: *"How do you verify that what colleagues are doing is actually authorized?"*
- **If they seem unclear**: *"What would happen if I asked three different people how to handle [specific security scenario]?"*

### **Red Flag Indicators:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Everyone knows how this really works"**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"We don't usually follow that formal process"**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Other teams just do it this way"**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"The boss said it was fine for everyone"**

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:**
- Instead of: *"Your employees are psychologically manipulated"*
- Say: *"We've identified some process gaps that create security vulnerabilities"*

- Instead of: *"People blindly follow authority"*
- Say: *"Verification procedures could be strengthened for executive requests"*
