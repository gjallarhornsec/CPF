   - YES: Documented training with technical authority focus
   - NO: No recent training or general security training only

‚ñ° **Q5**: Does the organization maintain logs of all external technical support interactions?
   - YES: Systematic logging with regular review
   - NO: Inconsistent or no logging of technical contacts

‚ñ° **Q6**: Are there documented incidents of employees refusing suspicious technical requests in the last 6 months?
   - YES: Evidence of successful refusal/reporting
   - NO: No documented refusals or reporting

‚ñ° **Q7**: Do non-technical employees have access to a verification database or contact list for legitimate technical vendors?
   - YES: Accessible database with current vendor contacts
   - NO: No centralized verification resource available

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Technical support verification procedures** (written policy)
- [ ] **Vendor contact database** or approved technical support list
- [ ] **Training records** for technical authority awareness (last 12 months)
- [ ] **IT service management logs** showing external support requests
- [ ] **Security incident reports** involving technical impersonation attempts
- [ ] **Help desk procedures** for verifying caller identity

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] **"Show me how an employee would verify a technical support call"**
- [ ] **"Walk through your vendor approval process"**
- [ ] **"Demonstrate your IT service request system"**
- [ ] **"Show me your technical support contact database"**

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Review IT ticketing system** for external support requests
- [ ] **Check approval workflows** for technical access
- [ ] **Examine training completion records** in LMS
- [ ] **Verify callback procedures** are accessible to staff

### Interview Targets (15 minutes total)
- [ ] **IT Manager/CISO** (5 min): Verification policies and procedures
- [ ] **Help Desk Staff** (5 min): Daily verification practices
- [ ] **Non-technical Employee** (5 min): Knowledge of verification process

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here**: Does organization have written technical support verification procedures?

**NO** ‚Üí **RED (2)**

**YES** ‚Üì

Are verification procedures consistently followed by employees?
- **Check training records + incident logs + interview responses**

**Inconsistent/Partial** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

**Consistent** ‚Üì

Has organization documented successful refusal of suspicious technical requests in last 6 months?

**NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

**YES** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**

### Objective Scoring Criteria

**GREEN (0)**: ‚úÖ All 7 quick assessment questions = YES
**YELLOW (1)**: ‚úÖ 4-6 quick assessment questions = YES  
**RED (2)**: ‚úÖ 0-3 quick assessment questions = YES

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION

**Technical Authority Verification Protocol**
- **Cost**: Low | **Time**: 2-4 weeks | **Dependencies**: None
- **Action**: Create callback verification procedure with laminated reference cards

**Centralized Technical Support Log**
- **Cost**: Low | **Time**: 1-2 weeks | **Dependencies**: IT ticketing system
- **Action**: Designate single point of contact for all external technical requests

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM IMPLEMENTATION

**Technical Request Authorization Workflow**
- **Cost**: Medium | **Time**: 4-8 weeks | **Dependencies**: Digital approval system
- **Action**: Deploy automated approval system with supervisor requirements

**Technical Impersonation Simulation Training**
- **Cost**: Medium | **Time**: 6-12 weeks | **Dependencies**: Training team
- **Action**: Quarterly simulated technical support calls with compliance tracking

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM IMPLEMENTATION

**Vendor Authentication Database**
- **Cost**: High | **Time**: 12-16 weeks | **Dependencies**: Vendor coordination
- **Action**: Secure database with legitimate vendor contacts and verification questions

**Technical Request Documentation Standard**
- **Cost**: Medium | **Time**: 8-12 weeks | **Dependencies**: Process redesign
- **Action**: Mandatory written documentation with monthly audit process

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
- *"How often do your employees get unsolicited calls from people claiming to be IT support?"*
- *"What happens when someone calls claiming they need a password for a system update?"*
- *"Can you walk me through your last interaction with external technical support?"*

### Follow-up Prompts for Incomplete Answers
- **If no verification process**: *"How do employees know if a technical caller is legitimate?"*
- **If informal process**: *"Is this procedure written down anywhere employees can reference it?"*
- **If no training**: *"How do non-technical staff recognize fake IT support calls?"*
- **If no logging**: *"How would you know if an attacker posed as technical support?"*

### Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation
- **"We trust our employees to use good judgment"** ‚Üí Investigate verification protocols
- **"IT support doesn't usually call us"** ‚Üí Check for recent unsolicited contacts
- **"Our staff would never give out passwords"** ‚Üí Test with scenarios
- **"We have good relationships with our vendors"** ‚Üí Verify authentication methods

### Professional Language for Sensitive Findings
- **Instead of**: "Your employees are vulnerable to technical social engineering"
- **Say**: "We identified opportunities to strengthen your technical support verification procedures"

- **Instead of**: "Anyone could impersonate your IT support"
- **Say**: "Enhanced verification protocols would provide additional security for technical interactions"
