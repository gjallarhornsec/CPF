# CPF Category 1: Authority-Based Vulnerabilities

This category addresses vulnerabilities arising from hierarchical structures and authority relationships within organizations, based on Stanley Milgram's obedience studies (1974). These vulnerabilities manifest when individuals prioritize compliance with perceived authority over security protocols, creating exploitable gaps in organizational defenses.

## Subcategories

### 1.1 Unquestioning Compliance with Apparent Authority
The human tendency to automatically comply with instructions from perceived authority figures without proper verification or critical assessment. This vulnerability is exploited in CEO fraud and fake IT support scams where attackers impersonate authority figures to bypass security protocols.

### 1.2 Diffusion of Responsibility in Hierarchical Structures
Security responsibility becomes diluted in hierarchical organizations, leading to assumptions that "someone else" is handling security matters. This creates gaps in coverage and delayed response to security incidents due to ambiguous accountability structures.

### 1.3 Authority Figure Impersonation Susceptibility
The psychological readiness to accept and comply with instructions from individuals presenting themselves as authority figures, even without proper authentication. This vulnerability is particularly exploited in spear phishing campaigns targeting specific organizational roles.

### 1.4 Bypassing Security for Superior's Convenience
The practice of circumventing security protocols to accommodate requests from superiors or to streamline their workflow. This creates intentional security gaps that can be exploited by malicious actors aware of these convenience-based exceptions.

### 1.5 Fear-Based Compliance Without Verification
Security decisions driven by fear of authority repercussions rather than rational security assessment. Employees may comply with questionable requests due to anxiety about job security or negative performance evaluations.

### 1.6 Authority Gradient Inhibiting Security Reporting
The hierarchical distance between employees and management that discourages reporting of security concerns or potential incidents. This creates information silos and prevents early detection of security issues.

### 1.7 Deference to Technical Authority Claims
Automatic acceptance of instructions from individuals claiming technical expertise without verification of their credentials or the validity of their requests. This vulnerability is exploited in social engineering attacks targeting non-technical staff.

### 1.8 Executive Exception Normalization
The gradual acceptance of security exceptions for executives as standard practice, creating privileged attack vectors. These exceptions often lack proper security oversight and become institutionalized vulnerabilities.

### 1.9 Authority-Based Social Proof
The use of authority figures to validate suspicious requests through implied or explicit endorsement. Attackers leverage this by name-dropping executives or creating fabricated authorization documents.

### 1.10 Crisis Authority Escalation
Increased deference to authority figures during crisis situations, leading to rushed security bypasses and reduced verification procedures. Attackers often create false urgency to exploit this vulnerability.
