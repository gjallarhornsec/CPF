## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"In the past 6 months, how many times have employees received urgent requests from executives that seemed unusual?"**
- *Follow-up*: "What happened in those situations?"
- *Red flag*: Any bypassed procedures or unverified compliance

**"When someone claiming to be IT support asks employees to disable security software, what's the standard response?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Can you show me the last time this happened?"  
- *Red flag*: Automatic compliance without verification

**"What typically happens to employees who question requests from senior leadership?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Can you give me a specific recent example?"
- *Red flag*: Punishment, discouragement, or negative consequences

### Probing for Red Flags
‚ñ° **"We trust our executives"** (indicates blind authority compliance)  
‚ñ° **"Questioning slows things down"** (efficiency over security priority)  
‚ñ° **"Employees know who to trust"** (assumption without verification)  
‚ñ° **"We've never had problems"** (lack of visibility into incidents)  

### Professional Sensitivity Notes
- Frame as "verification protocols" not "trust issues"
- Emphasize protection of executives from impersonation
- Position as industry best practice, not organizational weakness
- Use regulatory compliance angle when appropriate
