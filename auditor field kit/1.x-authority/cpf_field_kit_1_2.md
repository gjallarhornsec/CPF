## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each question:**

‚òê **YES** ‚òê **NO** - Does the organization have a written document listing specific individuals (not just roles) authorized to make security decisions?

‚òê **YES** ‚òê **NO** - Can security decisions for critical issues be made in under 30 minutes without multiple approvals?

‚òê **YES** ‚òê **NO** - Is there a named individual available 24/7 who can authorize emergency security actions?

‚òê **YES** ‚òê **NO** - Do departments meet monthly or more to clarify security responsibilities between teams?

‚òê **YES** ‚òê **NO** - Are security responsibilities assigned to specific people rather than departments in policy documents?

‚òê **YES** ‚òê **NO** - Does patch management have a named person accountable for each step of the process?

‚òê **YES** ‚òê **NO** - Are individual security performance metrics tracked and tied to employee reviews?

**Scoring Preview:** 6-7 YES = Green | 4-5 YES = Yellow | 0-3 YES = Red

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**START HERE:** Review Quick Assessment results

**IF 6-7 YES responses:**
- ‚úÖ **GREEN (0)** - Named individuals have clear authority, decisions under 30 minutes, regular coordination

**IF 4-5 YES responses:**
- Check: Are critical decisions delayed 30min-4hrs? ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è **YELLOW (1)**
- Check: Mixed individual/department assignments? ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è **YELLOW (1)**

**IF 0-3 YES responses:**
- Check: Are critical decisions delayed 4+ hours? ‚Üí üö® **RED (2)**
- Check: Only department-level assignments? ‚Üí üö® **RED (2)**

### Objective Thresholds:
- **Decision Speed**: Under 30min = Green | 30min-4hrs = Yellow | 4+ hrs = Red
- **Authority Assignment**: Named persons = Green | Mixed = Yellow | Departments only = Red
- **Coordination**: Monthly+ = Green | Quarterly = Yellow | Ad-hoc/None = Red

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Security Authority Matrix** (Low Cost)
  - Create named-person decision document
  - 2-week implementation
  - Requires: Management approval only

- **Decision Time Limits** (Low Cost)
  - Set 30min/4hr/24hr response requirements
  - 1-week implementation
  - Requires: Policy update

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM IMPLEMENTATION  
- **Security Champions Network** (Medium Cost)
  - Monthly cross-department meetings
  - 4-6 week implementation
  - Requires: Champion selection, training

- **Individual Scorecards** (Medium Cost)
  - Personal security metrics tracking
  - 6-8 week implementation
  - Requires: HR system integration

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM IMPLEMENTATION
- **Automated Decision Workflows** (High Cost)
  - SOAR platform for routine decisions
  - 3-6 month implementation
  - Requires: Technology investment

- **Incident Command Structure** (Medium Cost)
  - Bypass hierarchy during incidents
  - 2-3 month implementation
  - Requires: Cultural change management

### Dependencies:
- Executive buy-in required for authority changes
- HR involvement needed for individual metrics
- IT resources required for automation solutions

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"When you discover a potential security issue, who do you contact first?"**
- Follow-up: *"How long does it typically take to get permission to act?"*

**"What happens if a security problem occurs at 2 AM on Saturday?"**  
- Follow-up: *"Who has the authority to shut down systems or block traffic?"*

**"How do different departments coordinate on security responsibilities?"**
- Follow-up: *"When was your last cross-department security meeting?"*

### Red Flag Indicators:
- üö® "We have a committee that meets to discuss..." 
- üö® "It depends on who's available..."
- üö® "That's not really my area..."
- üö® "We'd need to check with several people..."
- üö® "The policy says to contact the department..."

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:
**Instead of**: "Your security is broken"
**Say**: "We've identified opportunities to streamline your security decision-making"

**Instead of**: "No one is accountable"  
**Say**: "There may be opportunities to clarify security responsibilities"

**Instead of**: "This creates vulnerabilities"
**Say**: "This structure may slow incident response times"
