## Stress Contagion Cascades

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each item:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Does the organization have written stress management protocols for security incidents?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Are there formal procedures for rotating security staff during incidents lasting >8 hours?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Is there a single designated communication channel for security incident coordination?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Have security leaders completed stress management or incident command training in the past 12 months?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Are there documented procedures for maintaining decision authority during high-stress periods?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Does the organization conduct regular stress simulation exercises for security teams?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Are there automated systems that trigger stress reduction protocols during incidents?

**STOP**: If 0-2 YES answers = RED | 3-5 YES answers = YELLOW | 6-7 YES answers = GREEN

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### **Documents to Request:**
- [ ] Security incident response procedures (look for stress management sections)
- [ ] Security team rotation schedules and policies
- [ ] Training records for security leadership (last 12 months)
- [ ] Communication protocols for security incidents
- [ ] Post-incident review reports (last 3 major incidents)
- [ ] Security team attendance records during/after incidents

### **Demonstrations to Request:**
- [ ] "Show me your incident command structure during a security event"
- [ ] "Walk me through your communication channels during the last major incident"
- [ ] "Demonstrate your automated monitoring for team stress indicators"

### **System Checks:**
- [ ] Review communication platform logs during recent incidents
- [ ] Check for automated rotation/break scheduling systems
- [ ] Examine monitoring dashboards for team performance metrics
- [ ] Verify backup team member assignments and contact lists

### **Interview Targets:**
- [ ] CISO or Security Director
- [ ] SOC Manager or Incident Response Lead  
- [ ] 2-3 Front-line Security Analysts
- [ ] HR Representative (for stress-related policies)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree:**

**START HERE** ‚Üí Count total YES answers from Quick Assessment

**IF 6-7 YES:**
- AND formal rotation procedures exist ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**
- BUT procedures are informal only ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

**IF 3-5 YES:**  
- AND some protocols exist but inconsistently applied ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**
- BUT multiple communication channels used during incidents ‚Üí **RED (2)**

**IF 0-2 YES:**
- No formal procedures OR leadership stress visibly impacts teams ‚Üí **RED (2)**

### **Objective Thresholds:**
- **GREEN**: Documented procedures + recent training + single communication channel
- **YELLOW**: Some procedures + partial training + occasional protocol bypassing  
- **RED**: No procedures + no training + multiple communication channels + frequent conflicts

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### **HIGH IMPACT - QUICK IMPLEMENTATION**
- [ ] **Communication Channel Discipline** (Cost: Low, Time: 1-2 weeks)
  - Designate single incident communication channel
  - Train team on channel protocols

- [ ] **Basic Rotation Procedures** (Cost: Low, Time: 2-4 weeks)  
  - Create written rotation schedules for extended incidents
  - Assign backup team members

### **HIGH IMPACT - LONG TERM**
- [ ] **Incident Command Training** (Cost: Medium, Time: 2-3 months)
  - Formal ICS training for security leaders
  - Regular refresher training schedule

- [ ] **Automated Circuit Breakers** (Cost: High, Time: 3-6 months)
  - Monitoring system for cascade indicators
  - Automatic stress reduction protocol triggers

### **MEDIUM IMPACT - MAINTENANCE**
- [ ] **Stress Inoculation Exercises** (Cost: Medium, Time: Ongoing)
  - Regular high-stress security simulations
  - Progressive difficulty scenarios

### **Dependencies:**
- Leadership buy-in required for training programs
- Budget approval needed for automation systems
- HR policy updates may be required

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions:**
1. "Tell me about your team's response during your most recent major security incident."
2. "How do you manage team fatigue during extended security responses?"
3. "What happens when multiple security issues occur at the same time?"

### **Follow-up Prompts:**
- **If they mention stress:** "How do you prevent one person's stress from affecting the whole team?"
- **If they mention communication:** "How many different channels were active during your last incident?"
- **If they mention procedures:** "Can you show me the written procedures for team rotation?"
- **If they mention training:** "When did your security leaders last receive stress management training?"

### **Red Flag Indicators:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "We just push through the stress"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Everyone was working around the clock"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "We had email, Slack, phone calls, and meetings all happening"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "The team was pretty burned out after that incident"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Leadership was visibly panicked during the incident"

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:**
- Instead of "stress management," use "incident response optimization"
- Instead of "team conflicts," use "coordination challenges"  
- Instead of "panic," use "heightened response urgency"
