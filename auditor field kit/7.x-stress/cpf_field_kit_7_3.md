# 📋 INDICATOR 7.3 FIELD KIT: Fight Response Aggression

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each:**

□ **Immediate Maximum Response**: Does the organization typically implement maximum security measures (network isolation, emergency protocols) within 15 minutes of detecting any potential threat?

□ **Frequent Business Disruption**: Do security tools (firewall, IPS, DLP) regularly block legitimate business activities requiring manual intervention more than weekly?

□ **Cross-Department Conflicts**: Have there been documented complaints or conflicts between security team and other business units in the past 90 days?

□ **Rapid Threat Attribution**: Does the security team typically assign blame/source for security incidents within the first hour without verification from multiple sources?

□ **No Pause Procedures**: Is there an absence of mandatory delay/verification steps before implementing disruptive security responses?

□ **Stress-Related Issues**: Are there signs of security team burnout, high turnover (>20% annually), or confrontational behavior during incidents?

□ **No Response Scaling**: Is there no documented process for reducing security response intensity once maximum measures are implemented?

**Scoring**: 0-1 YES = Green | 2-4 YES = Yellow | 5-7 YES = Red

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] **Incident response procedures** (escalation timelines and authorization requirements)
- [ ] **Security tool tuning logs** (false positive rates, business complaints)
- [ ] **Cross-department communications** (emails, tickets, meeting notes from past 60 days)
- [ ] **Recent incident reports** (last 3 security events with response timelines)
- [ ] **Security team performance metrics** (including business satisfaction scores)

### Demonstrations Needed:
- [ ] **"Show me your alert triage process"** - observe security team workflow during simulated alert
- [ ] **"Walk through your last incident response"** - review actual response timeline and decisions
- [ ] **"Demonstrate security tool tuning"** - show how false positives are addressed

### System Checks:
- [ ] **Security tool dashboards** - check false positive rates and business impact metrics
- [ ] **Incident tracking system** - verify response times and escalation patterns
- [ ] **Communication platforms** - review security team interaction patterns

### Interview Targets:
- [ ] **Security Team Lead** - incident response procedures and team stress management
- [ ] **Business Unit Manager** - relationship with security team, operational disruptions
- [ ] **IT Operations Lead** - coordination during security incidents
- [ ] **Recent Incident Participants** - actual experience during last security event

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**START:** Count YES answers from Quick Assessment

**IF 0-1 YES:**
→ **GREEN**: Measured response protocols in place

**IF 2-4 YES:**
→ Check: Are there documented procedures but inconsistent application?
  - YES → **YELLOW**: Partial controls need strengthening  
  - NO → **RED**: Systemic aggressive response pattern

**IF 5-7 YES:**
→ **RED**: High-risk aggressive response pattern

### Validation Check:
- [ ] **Business disruption >3x monthly** → Automatic YELLOW minimum
- [ ] **No verification procedures documented** → Automatic RED
- [ ] **Security team turnover >30% annually** → Automatic RED

- *Red flag*: Immediate maximum response without verification

**"How do other departments view working with your security team?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Can you give me a specific recent example?"
- *Red flag*: Consistent complaints about aggressive security enforcement
