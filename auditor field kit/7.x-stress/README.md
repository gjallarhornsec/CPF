# CPF Category 7: Stress Response Vulnerabilities

This category examines how physiological and psychological stress responses create systematic security weaknesses, drawing from Hans Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (1956) and contemporary research on stress physiology. These vulnerabilities emerge when acute or chronic stress impairs cognitive function, alters decision-making patterns, and disrupts normal security behaviors through well-documented neurobiological mechanisms.

## Subcategories

### 7.1 Acute Stress Impairment
The immediate degradation of cognitive function and security decision-making under sudden high-stress conditions. This vulnerability manifests as reduced working memory capacity, impaired threat assessment, and simplified decision heuristics during security incidents, often leading to inappropriate response choices and missed critical indicators when they're most needed.

### 7.2 Chronic Stress Burnout
The cumulative erosion of security vigilance and performance quality resulting from prolonged exposure to stress without adequate recovery. This vulnerability creates progressive desensitization to security alerts, reduced motivation for security tasks, and emotional detachment from security outcomes, making experienced professionals increasingly vulnerable to oversights and errors.

### 7.3 Fight Response Aggression
The security vulnerability that emerges when stress triggers aggressive, confrontational responses to security challenges. This can manifest as overly aggressive system lockdowns, inappropriate escalation of security incidents, or adversarial approaches to legitimate user errors that damage organizational security culture and create additional vulnerabilities.

### 7.4 Flight Response Avoidance
The tendency to avoid or delay addressing security issues when under stress, particularly when tasks appear overwhelming or threatening. This vulnerability leads to postponed security updates, ignored security alerts, and deferred incident investigation, creating extended windows of exposure and allowing security problems to escalate untreated.

### 7.5 Freeze Response Paralysis
The cognitive and behavioral shutdown that occurs under extreme stress, rendering individuals unable to take appropriate security actions. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous during active security incidents when immediate response is critical, potentially turning containable breaches into major security disasters due to inaction.

### 7.6 Fawn Response Overcompliance
The counterproductive security behavior where stress triggers excessive compliance with requests, including malicious ones, in an attempt to reduce social tension or conflict. This vulnerability is exploited through social engineering attacks that create artificial stress to induce compliance with security-bypassing requests.

### 7.7 Stress-Induced Tunnel Vision
The cognitive narrowing of attention that occurs under stress, causing focus on limited aspects of security situations while ignoring broader context. This vulnerability leads to missed attack patterns, failure to connect related security events, and inadequate situational awareness during complex security incidents.

### 7.8 Cortisol-Impaired Memory
The disruption of memory formation and recall capabilities due to elevated cortisol levels during stress. This vulnerability affects security incident documentation, evidence collection, and post-incident analysis, potentially compromising legal proceedings and organizational learning from security events.

### 7.9 Stress Contagion Cascades
The phenomenon where stress spreads through security teams and organizations, amplifying individual stress responses through social transmission. This vulnerability can trigger organization-wide security degradation during crises as stressed individuals influence colleagues' emotional states and performance capabilities.

### 7.10 Recovery Period Vulnerabilities
The extended period of reduced security capability following acute stress exposure, during which cognitive function remains impaired despite the stressor's removal. This vulnerability creates secondary attack windows when organizations are psychologically depleted after handling major incidents, making them vulnerable to follow-up attacks.
