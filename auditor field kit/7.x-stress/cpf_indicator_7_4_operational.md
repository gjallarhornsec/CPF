# CPF INDICATOR 7.4: FLIGHT RESPONSE AVOIDANCE

## CONTEXT

Flight response avoidance occurs when security personnel systematically avoid making critical security decisions or confronting security issues during high-stress situations, instead deferring, delegating, or delaying action. This psychological pattern creates dangerous security gaps because attackers exploit the decision delays and avoidance behaviors to maintain persistence and expand their access. Organizations experience this as unexplained delays in incident response, reluctance to escalate security issues, and security decisions that get "stuck in committee" during critical moments.

## ASSESSMENT

**Question 1: Decision Timeline Tracking**
How long does it typically take your organization to make critical security decisions during an incident (from identification to action)? Tell us about a specific recent security incident and the decision timeline.

**Question 2: Escalation Authority**
When security personnel encounter issues requiring difficult decisions (like shutting down systems or confronting users), what's your standard procedure? Give us a recent example where someone had to make a tough security call.

**Question 3: Meeting and Communication Patterns**
How often do key security personnel miss or reschedule security incident meetings, and what's your policy for mandatory attendance? Describe a recent incident where attendance affected response quality.

**Question 4: Delegation During Crisis**
What happens when your primary security decision-makers are unavailable during incidents? Tell us about a time when security responsibilities were passed between multiple people during an active issue.

**Question 5: Complex Issue Response**
How does your team handle security issues that don't have clear-cut solutions or might impact business operations? Provide an example of how you handled a recent complex security versus business conflict.

**Question 6: Stress Response Documentation**
Do you track patterns in security decision-making effectiveness during high-stress periods versus normal operations? What differences have you observed in your team's responsiveness?

**Question 7: Authority Conflict Resolution**
What's your process when security requirements conflict with executive or departmental priorities? Give us a specific example of how such a conflict was resolved recently.

## SCORING

**Green (0): Low Vulnerability**
- Security decisions consistently made within 4 hours during incidents
- Clear escalation paths with documented authority at each level
- Security personnel regularly attend incident meetings (>90% attendance)
- Delegation follows documented procedures with clear handoffs
- Complex issues have defined resolution processes with timeframes
- No observable pattern of decision delays during high-stress periods
- Authority conflicts resolved through documented processes within 24 hours

**Yellow (1): Moderate Vulnerability**
- Security decisions delayed 4-24 hours during incidents
- Escalation paths exist but authority boundaries unclear in some scenarios
- Security personnel attendance at incident meetings inconsistent (70-90%)
- Some delegation occurs without clear procedures or documentation
- Complex issues sometimes delayed beyond necessary analysis time
- Occasional patterns of slower decision-making under stress
- Authority conflicts sometimes require external intervention to resolve

**Red (2): High Vulnerability**
- Security decisions delayed >24 hours during incidents or indefinitely postponed
- Unclear escalation paths or authority boundaries for security decisions
- Frequent absence from security meetings or incident response (<70% attendance)
- Regular informal delegation without procedures or accountability
- Complex issues routinely deferred or avoided rather than resolved
- Consistent patterns of decision avoidance during high-stress situations
- Authority conflicts remain unresolved or create ongoing security gaps

## RISK SCENARIOS

**Scenario 1: Extended Dwell Time Exploitation**
Attackers time their activities during periods when key security personnel exhibit avoidance behaviors, such as end-of-quarter business pressure or major system updates. The delayed security response allows attackers additional weeks to establish persistence, steal data, and prepare lateral movement before detection systems are properly investigated.

**Scenario 2: Authority Escalation Attack**
Social engineers deliberately create security incidents that require confronting senior executives or business unit leaders, knowing that security personnel will avoid direct confrontation. While security teams delay escalation or seek alternative approaches, attackers use the time gap to complete data exfiltration or system compromise.

**Scenario 3: Complexity Overwhelm Campaign**
Sophisticated attackers launch multi-vector attacks designed to create cognitive overload in security operations teams. When overwhelmed personnel avoid making rapid containment decisions, attackers exploit the decision paralysis to pivot between systems and establish multiple persistence mechanisms across the network.

**Scenario 4: Crisis Decision Exploitation**
During organizational stress periods (layoffs, mergers, system outages), attackers launch campaigns that require security decisions conflicting with business continuity. Security personnel's flight response leads to delayed patching, reduced monitoring, and acceptance of temporary security workarounds that attackers exploit for long-term access.

## SOLUTION CATALOG

**Solution 1: Automated Decision Support System**
Implement decision trees and automated workflows that provide clear action steps for common security scenarios, reducing cognitive load on personnel during stress situations. Include automatic escalation timers and pre-approved response procedures that eliminate decision paralysis during incidents.

**Solution 2: Authority Matrix Documentation**
Create explicit authority matrices defining who can make what security decisions under various circumstances, including emergency authorization procedures. Include escalation timeframes and alternate decision-makers to prevent bottlenecks when primary personnel are unavailable or avoiding decisions.

**Solution 3: Stress Inoculation Training Program**
Conduct regular incident response simulations that progressively increase complexity and stress levels, building team tolerance for high-pressure security decisions. Include scenarios requiring difficult business conversations and authority confrontation to desensitize personnel to avoidance triggers.

**Solution 4: Decision Timeline Monitoring**
Implement tracking systems that monitor security decision latency and automatically alert management when decisions exceed established timeframes. Create dashboards showing decision patterns and bottlenecks to identify avoidance behaviors before they impact security.

**Solution 5: Buddy System Protocol**
Establish paired decision-making for high-stress security situations, where two personnel must jointly approve action plans. This reduces individual anxiety about making wrong decisions while ensuring decisions still get made promptly during incidents.

**Solution 6: Pre-Authorization Framework**
Develop pre-authorized response procedures for common security scenarios that eliminate in-the-moment decision-making requirements. Include business impact pre-approvals and stakeholder communication templates to reduce friction during incident response.
