## INDICATOR 3.2: COMMITMENT ESCALATION TRAPS

### CONTEXT

Commitment escalation traps occur when organizations continue investing in failing security measures or expanding risky access permissions simply because they made an initial commitment, rather than objectively evaluating current effectiveness. This psychological pattern creates vulnerabilities where attackers can exploit established trust relationships and gradually escalate their access by leveraging an organization's reluctance to question or reverse previous security decisions. In practice, this manifests as security exception requests that progressively expand in scope, vendor relationships that grow beyond appropriate boundaries, and security technologies that continue receiving investment despite poor performance.

### ASSESSMENT

**Question 1**: How often do you grant security policy exceptions, and what's your process for reviewing whether temporary exceptions have become permanent practices?
*Tell us your specific example of a recent exception request and how it was handled.*

**Question 2**: When you implement new security tools or processes, what's your procedure for evaluating their effectiveness and making changes if they're not working as expected?
*Give us an example of a security solution you've modified or replaced in the past year.*

**Question 3**: How do you handle situations where a vendor or business partner requests expanded access beyond their original scope of work?
*Describe a recent situation where someone asked for additional system access or data permissions.*

**Question 4**: What happens when an employee or department repeatedly requests exceptions to security policies for "urgent business needs"?
*Tell us about a recent pattern of exception requests from the same source.*

**Question 5**: How do you track and review long-term security investments to ensure they're still providing value?
*Give us an example of how you've evaluated whether to continue or discontinue a security initiative.*

**Question 6**: What's your process when audit findings or security incidents suggest that current practices need to change?
*Describe how you handled feedback that challenged an existing security approach.*

**Question 7**: How do you prevent "scope creep" in vendor relationships or employee access permissions over time?
*Tell us about your procedures for periodic access reviews and relationship boundary maintenance.*

### SCORING

**Green (0)**: Organization has documented processes for regularly reviewing security decisions, demonstrates clear examples of discontinuing ineffective security measures, maintains strict vendor access boundaries with regular reviews, and shows evidence of adapting security approaches based on new information or changing circumstances.

**Yellow (1)**: Organization has some review processes but applies them inconsistently, shows mixed results in questioning existing security commitments, has occasional examples of security approach changes but also evidence of maintaining failing practices, or demonstrates partial success in preventing access scope creep.

**Red (2)**: Organization lacks systematic review processes for security decisions, shows clear patterns of maintaining ineffective security measures due to prior investment, demonstrates vendor or access relationships that have expanded beyond original scope without justification, or shows resistance to changing security approaches despite evidence of ineffectiveness.

### RISK SCENARIOS

**Progressive Vendor Compromise**: Attackers compromise a legitimate vendor who already has established access to your systems. They exploit your organization's commitment to the vendor relationship to gradually request expanded access privileges, additional system permissions, or access to more sensitive data. Your reluctance to question an "established partner" enables the attacker to move laterally through your network over months.

**Social Engineering Escalation Chains**: An attacker poses as someone who has previously provided legitimate help to your employees (IT support, consultant, etc.). They leverage your staff's commitment to being helpful and consistent with past cooperation to request increasingly sensitive information or access. What starts as "verify this system configuration" escalates to "please reset this admin password" because your employees want to maintain consistency with their helpful behavior.

**Insider Threat Through Role Expansion**: A legitimate employee gradually expands their data access and system privileges through incremental requests justified by evolving job responsibilities. Your organization's commitment to supporting employee growth and avoiding the awkwardness of questioning trusted staff enables systematic data theft or system compromise that appears to follow normal business processes.

**Business Email Compromise Evolution**: Attackers exploit your organization's commitment to customer service or vendor relationships by impersonating established business contacts. They start with minor requests consistent with normal business interactions, then escalate to fraudulent payment requests or sensitive data sharing. Your finance or operations teams' commitment to being responsive to "known contacts" prevents proper verification of escalating requests.

### SOLUTION CATALOG

**Automated Exception Sunset System**: Implement technology that automatically expires all security policy exceptions after a defined period (30-90 days) unless explicitly renewed with fresh justification. Configure your access management system to flag and disable temporary permissions that haven't been reviewed. This prevents exceptions from becoming permanent practices and forces periodic re-evaluation of security decisions.

**Vendor Access Boundary Monitoring**: Deploy monitoring tools that track and alert on vendor access pattern changes, unusual data volumes, or attempts to access systems outside their original scope. Create automated reports showing vendor access trends over time and implement approval workflows for any vendor access expansion requests that require business justification and security review.

**Security Investment Review Process**: Establish quarterly "security portfolio reviews" where teams must present evidence of effectiveness for ongoing security initiatives using specific metrics (incident reduction, cost per protected asset, user compliance rates). Create a formal process for discontinuing underperforming security investments and reallocating resources, including clear criteria for when to "sunset" security tools or processes.

**Independent Access Review Teams**: Form cross-functional teams (including members not involved in original access decisions) to conduct periodic reviews of user permissions, vendor relationships, and security exceptions. Give these teams authority to question existing commitments and recommend changes without requiring approval from the original decision-makers, preventing ego investment from blocking necessary security improvements.

**Escalation Pattern Detection**: Implement behavioral analytics that flag unusual patterns in help desk requests, system access attempts, or data queries that show gradual escalation from the same sources. Configure alerts for repeated exception requests from the same individuals or departments, and create workflows that require additional approvals when request patterns suggest potential commitment exploitation.

**Decision Revision Protocols**: Create formal processes that celebrate and reward security approach changes based on new evidence rather than treating them as admissions of failure. Establish "pivot protocols" that provide face-saving ways for teams to modify security commitments, including standard communications templates that frame changes as organizational learning rather than previous mistakes.

### SUCCESS METRICS

**Exception Normalization Rate**: Measure the percentage of temporary security exceptions that become permanent without proper review. Target: Reduce from baseline to less than 5% of exceptions becoming permanent. Measure monthly by comparing active exceptions to their original expiration dates and justification updates.

**Security Investment ROI Improvement**: Track the cost-effectiveness ratio of security investments before and after implementing review processes. Target: Improve security ROI by 25% within 12 months through better resource allocation. Measure quarterly using metrics like cost per incident prevented or user compliance improvement per dollar spent.

**Access Scope Expansion Incidents**: Count the number of security incidents attributable to gradual escalation of access permissions or vendor relationships beyond appropriate boundaries. Target: Reduce scope expansion incidents by 40% within 6 months. Measure through incident analysis reports that specifically identify escalation factors as contributing causes.
