## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Decision Tree - Follow path based on Quick Assessment results:**

**7 YES responses** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**: Low Vulnerability
- All controls present and functioning

**4-6 YES responses** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**: Moderate Vulnerability  
- Core controls exist but gaps in enforcement or coverage

**0-3 YES responses** ‚Üí **RED (2)**: High Vulnerability
- Critical controls missing or non-functional

**Override Rules** (Force RED regardless of score):
‚ñ° Recent reciprocity-based security incident (past 6 months)
‚ñ° No gift policy OR policy completely unenforced
‚ñ° USB auto-run enabled organization-wide
‚ñ° Zero reciprocity training in past 24 months

**Final Score**: _____ (0=Green, 1=Yellow, 2=Red)

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"How do you currently handle situations where vendors or external parties offer your staff help, gifts, or free services?"**

*Follow-up if unclear*: "Can you give me a specific recent example?"

**"What happens when someone receives help from an outsider and then that person asks for something in return?"**

*Listen for*: Automatic compliance, no delay, no approval process

### Red Flag Indicators
‚ñ° **"We trust our people's judgment"** (no formal controls)
‚ñ° **"It's just common courtesy"** (reciprocity pressure accepted as normal)
‚ñ° **"We haven't had problems"** (lack of incident awareness)
‚ñ° **"Our staff know not to..."** (reliance on individual judgment only)

### Probing Questions for Incomplete Answers
- "Who would an employee report suspicious offers to?"
- "How long after receiving help would someone typically respond to requests?"
- "What's the largest gift or favor value someone could accept without approval?"
- "When did you last have training that specifically covered quid pro quo attacks?"

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
**Instead of**: "Your employees are vulnerable to manipulation"
**Say**: "We want to ensure your staff have clear protocols for handling external offers"

**Instead of**: "This is a major security gap"  
**Say**: "This represents an opportunity to strengthen your security posture"
