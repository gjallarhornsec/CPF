# 📋 CPF INDICATOR 3.8 FIELD KIT
## Conformity to Insecure Norms

---

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

□ **Policy Workarounds**: Do employees regularly mention needing to "work around" security policies to complete tasks?

□ **Exception Normalization**: Are security exceptions/bypasses documented in informal channels (emails, chats, wikis) as standard procedures?

□ **Leadership Modeling**: Has leadership been observed or reported bypassing security requirements during urgent situations?

□ **Training-Reality Gap**: Do new employees report that actual practices differ significantly from security training?

□ **Department Variations**: Do different departments implement the same security policy in notably different ways?

□ **Pressure Point Failures**: Are there documented instances of security steps being skipped during deadlines or outages?

□ **Social Justification**: Do employees use phrases like "everyone does it this way" or "this is how we've always done it" when explaining security practices?

**SCORING TRIGGER**: 4+ YES answers = RED zone investigation required

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### **Documents to Request:**
□ Last 6 months of IT help desk tickets related to security issues
□ Recent employee onboarding feedback surveys or exit interview summaries
□ Any documented security exceptions or policy waivers
□ Cross-departmental policy implementation guides or procedures
□ Recent leadership communications during security incidents

### **System Demonstrations:**
□ "Show me how a new employee typically accesses [critical system] on their first day"
□ "Walk through your standard password reset process"
□ "Demonstrate how urgent requests are processed outside normal hours"

### **Direct Observations:**
□ Monitor hallway/informal conversations about security procedures (15 minutes)
□ Check for posted informal "cheat sheets" or workaround instructions
□ Review shared network drives for unofficial security guidance documents

### **Key Interview Targets:**
□ **IT Help Desk Staff** - What are the most common security-related requests?
□ **Department Supervisors** - How do you handle security compliance vs. productivity conflicts?
□ **Recent Hires** (3-6 months) - How did you learn the "real" way to do things here?
□ **Long-term Employees** - What security practices have evolved over time?

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree:**

**START HERE** → Are documented policies followed >90% of the time across all departments?

├─ **YES** → Are exceptions formally documented and time-limited?
│  ├─ **YES** → **GREEN (0)** - Strong norm alignment
│  └─ **NO** → **YELLOW (1)** - Some informal practices exist

└─ **NO** → Do multiple departments have institutionalized workarounds?
   ├─ **NO** → **YELLOW (1)** - Limited norm deviation
   └─ **YES** → Does leadership model security bypass behaviors?
      ├─ **NO** → **YELLOW (1)** - Cultural drift contained
      └─ **YES** → **RED (2)** - Widespread cultural acceptance of insecurity

### **Objective Thresholds:**
- **GREEN**: <10% policy deviation rate, <5% undocumented exceptions
- **YELLOW**: 10-30% deviation rate, 5-20% undocumented exceptions  
- **RED**: >30% deviation rate, >20% undocumented exceptions, leadership non-compliance

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions:**
- "When your team faces tight deadlines, what security steps typically need to be adjusted?"
- "How do employees typically learn the practical way to handle security requirements?"
- "Can you give me an example of a security policy that's challenging to implement exactly as written?"

### **Follow-up Prompts:**
- **If they mention workarounds**: "How often does this happen? Is it documented anywhere?"
- **If they mention exceptions**: "What's the formal approval process? How long do these typically last?"
- **If they mention leadership**: "Can you give me a specific recent example?"

### **Red Flag Indicators:**
- Phrases like "We have to" or "There's no choice but to..."
- References to "the way things really work here"
- Mentions of different practices between teams/departments
- Stories of security being bypassed during crisis situations

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:**
- Instead of "policy violations" → "implementation variations"
- Instead of "non-compliance" → "process adaptations" 
- Instead of "security failures" → "operational adjustments"
