# üìã INDICATOR 3.10 FIELD KIT: Reputation Management Conflicts

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization received >15% security exception requests in past quarter  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Credential sharing occurs among collaborative/client-facing teams  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security incident reporting averages >8 hours from discovery  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Executive requests bypass normal verification processes  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Performance reviews exclude security compliance metrics  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Employees regularly cite "client relationships" for security bypasses  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security procedures visibly degrade during deadline periods  

**Quick Score**: 0-2 YES = Green | 3-4 YES = Yellow | 5+ YES = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Security exception log** (past 6 months with approval rates)
- [ ] **Incident response timeline** records (discovery to notification)
- [ ] **Employee performance review templates** (check for security metrics)
- [ ] **Client accommodation procedures** (written policies)
- [ ] **Executive request protocols** (verification requirements)

### System Demonstrations
- [ ] **Show exception approval workflow** (if automated system exists)
- [ ] **Demo user access analytics** (credential sharing detection)
- [ ] **Display incident reporting system** (average response times)
- [ ] **Review behavioral analytics** (reputation-related risk patterns)

### Key Interviews (15 min each)
- [ ] **IT Security Manager**: Exception handling, incident reporting delays
- [ ] **Sales/Client Manager**: Client accommodation pressures, credential sharing
- [ ] **HR/Performance Manager**: Security metrics in reviews, pressure patterns
- [ ] **Executive Assistant**: Executive request handling, verification bypass

### System Checks
- [ ] **Login analytics**: Evidence of shared credentials or unusual patterns
- [ ] **Exception dashboard**: Frequency, approvals, business justifications
- [ ] **Help desk tickets**: Security-related "urgent" requests from executives

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START**: Count YES answers from Quick Assessment

**IF 0-2 YES answers:**
- AND exception requests <5% of total ‚Üí **GREEN**
- AND incident reporting <2 hours average ‚Üí **GREEN**
- OTHERWISE ‚Üí **YELLOW**

**IF 3-4 YES answers:**
- AND >80% exception approval rate ‚Üí **RED**
- AND systematic security degradation during pressure ‚Üí **RED**
- OTHERWISE ‚Üí **YELLOW**

**IF 5+ YES answers:** ‚Üí **RED**

### Objective Thresholds
- **Exception Rate**: <5% = Green | 5-15% = Yellow | >15% = Red
- **Incident Reporting**: <2hr = Green | 2-8hr = Yellow | >8hr = Red
- **Performance Integration**: ‚â•20% weight = Green | Some mention = Yellow | None = Red

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your recent security exception requests..."**
- Follow-up: *"What percentage were approved and why?"*
- Red flag: *Approval rate >80% or vague justifications*

**"When clients ask you to bypass security for convenience..."**
- Follow-up: *"Can you give me a specific recent example?"*
- Red flag: *Routine bypasses with "relationship" justifications*

**"How quickly do security incidents get reported to IT?"**
- Follow-up: *"Tell me about a recent delay and the reason."*
- Red flag: *>8 hour delays or "investigation" excuses*

### Sensitive Topics Script
**For credential sharing:** *"I'm seeing some login patterns that suggest shared access. This is common in collaborative environments - can you help me understand your current practices?"*

**For executive pressure:** *"When senior leadership needs urgent exceptions, what's your standard process?"*

**For performance concerns:** *"How do your performance reviews balance security compliance with business objectives?"*
