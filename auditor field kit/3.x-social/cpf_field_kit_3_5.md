- NO: No systematic tracking or review of emergency access

‚ñ° **Q4:** Is there **specific training** on pressure-based decision making?
- YES: Training modules specifically address scarcity/urgency tactics
- NO: No targeted training on pressure-based social engineering

‚ñ° **Q5:** Are there **cooling-off periods** for high-pressure security decisions?
- YES: Documented delays built into critical security decisions
- NO: No mandatory waiting periods for security decisions

‚ñ° **Q6:** Do employees **routinely bypass** verification under deadline pressure?
- YES: Regular bypassing of security procedures during deadlines
- NO: Verification procedures maintained regardless of pressure

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Follow this decision tree:**

### **Step 1: Count YES answers from Quick Assessment**
- **5-7 YES answers** ‚Üí Proceed to GREEN criteria check
- **2-4 YES answers** ‚Üí Assign YELLOW
- **0-1 YES answers** ‚Üí Assign RED

### **Step 2: GREEN Criteria Verification** (if 5-7 YES)
**ALL must be true for GREEN:**
‚ñ° Emergency access audit shows <10% non-urgent usage
‚ñ° Dual approval system cannot be bypassed
‚ñ° Specific scarcity training with measurable completion rates
‚ñ° Zero tolerance policy for verification bypass

**If any GREEN criteria fails ‚Üí Assign YELLOW**

### **Final Score:**
- **GREEN (0):** Low vulnerability - strong controls present
- **YELLOW (1):** Moderate vulnerability - controls exist but inconsistent
- **RED (2):** High vulnerability - minimal or no controls
