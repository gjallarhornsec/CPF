# CPF Category 3: Social Influence Vulnerabilities

This category examines how social dynamics and interpersonal influence principles affect security behaviors, based on Robert Cialdini's six principles of influence (2007). These vulnerabilities emerge when social pressures, relationship dynamics, and group behaviors override individual security judgment and organizational protocols.

## Subcategories

### 3.1 Reciprocity Exploitation
The human tendency to feel obligated to return favors or concessions, which attackers exploit by offering small favors, free services, or helpful information to create a sense of indebtedness. This principle is weaponized in quid pro quo attacks where victims feel compelled to provide access, information, or bypass security in return for perceived benefits.

### 3.2 Commitment Escalation Traps
The psychological tendency to remain consistent with previous commitments, even when they become security risks. Attackers use small initial requests that gradually escalate to more significant security compromises, exploiting the victim's desire to maintain behavioral consistency with their earlier actions.

### 3.3 Social Proof Manipulation
The vulnerability created by the human tendency to look to others' behavior when determining appropriate actions. Attackers fabricate social evidence through fake testimonials, manipulated usage statistics, or false claims about widespread adoption to convince targets that security bypasses are normal or accepted behavior.

### 3.4 Liking-Based Trust Override
The security vulnerability that arises when affinity, similarity, or rapport building overrides security caution. Attackers invest time in building relationships, finding common ground, and creating positive impressions to lower security vigilance and increase compliance with malicious requests.

### 3.5 Scarcity-Driven Decisions
The cognitive bias where perceived scarcity or limited availability triggers rushed decisions and security bypasses. Attackers create artificial scarcity through time-limited offers, exclusive access claims, or limited availability warnings to pressure victims into acting without proper security verification.

### 3.6 Unity Principle Exploitation
The vulnerability that emerges from shared identities or group affiliations that create blind trust. Attackers pretend to share group memberships, organizational affiliations, or common causes to establish artificial kinship that bypasses normal security skepticism and verification processes.

### 3.7 Peer Pressure Compliance
The security compromise that occurs due to real or perceived pressure from colleagues, teammates, or social groups. Individuals may bypass security protocols, share credentials, or approve exceptional access due to social conformity pressures rather than security considerations.

### 3.8 Conformity to Insecure Norms
The tendency to adopt group behaviors and practices even when they conflict with security policies. This vulnerability creates organizational blind spots where insecure practices become normalized through social learning and imitation, making entire groups vulnerable to systematic attacks.

### 3.9 Social Identity Threats
The security vulnerabilities that emerge when individuals prioritize protecting their social standing or professional reputation over security best practices. Fear of social embarrassment, professional criticism, or group exclusion can lead to security incidents being concealed rather than reported.

### 3.10 Reputation Management Conflicts
The tension between maintaining professional reputation and following security protocols, which can lead to security bypasses when individuals perceive security measures as potentially damaging to their professional image or social standing within the organization.
