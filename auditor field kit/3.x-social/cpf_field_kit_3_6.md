# 📋 CPF FIELD KIT 3.6: Unity Principle Exploitation

**Assessment Focus**: Employee vulnerability to requests from people claiming shared affiliations (colleagues, alumni, industry peers)

---

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

□ **YES/NO**: Organization has written procedures requiring verification of external contacts claiming shared affiliations before sharing information

□ **YES/NO**: Employees can demonstrate specific identity verification steps they follow when contacted by claimed colleagues/partners

□ **YES/NO**: IT/Security team has documented protocols for handling requests from external "technical professionals"

□ **YES/NO**: Organization conducts training specifically covering identity-based social engineering (not just generic phishing)

□ **YES/NO**: Leadership team profiles on LinkedIn/company website limit exploitable professional/educational information

□ **YES/NO**: Organization monitors/logs external communications claiming internal affiliations for review

□ **YES/NO**: Different response procedures exist for verified vs. unverified external contacts

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- **Identity verification procedures** (any written protocols)
- **Security awareness training materials** (check for unity/identity content)
- **Incident response procedures** for social engineering
- **Social media/communication guidelines** for employees

### Demonstrations to Request:
- **"Show me how you verify"** when someone claims to be from a partner company
- **"Walk through your process"** for handling external IT professional requests
- **"Demonstrate the training"** employees receive about identity verification

### System Checks:
- **Email gateway settings** - does it flag identity claims or monitor external communications?
- **Access logs** - any tracking of verification requests or suspicious contacts?
- **Training completion records** - who has received identity-focused security training?

### Interview Targets:
- **IT/Security team member** (handling external technical requests)
- **HR representative** (alumni/professional network policies)
- **Front-line employee** (actual verification practices)
- **Manager/supervisor** (approval processes for external requests)

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**START HERE** → Does organization have written identity verification procedures?

**If YES** → Are procedures consistently followed by employees?
- **If YES** → Are there technical controls supporting verification?
  - **If YES** → **GREEN (0)**
  - **If NO** → **YELLOW (1)**
- **If NO** → **YELLOW (1)**

**If NO** → Do employees perform any informal verification?
- **If YES** → **YELLOW (1)**
- **If NO** → **RED (2)**

### Objective Thresholds:
- **GREEN**: Written procedures + >80% compliance + technical controls
- **YELLOW**: Some procedures OR informal verification + basic training
- **RED**: No systematic verification + minimal training + high response to unverified contacts

## 🔧 SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Identity Verification Protocol** (Cost: Low, Time: 2-4 weeks)
  - Create simple checklist for verifying claimed affiliations
  - Require one independent confirmation before sharing information
- **Digital Footprint Audit** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)
  - Review public information about leadership team
  - Update social media guidelines

### MEDIUM IMPACT / LONG-TERM
- **Unity-Aware Security Training** (Cost: Medium, Time: 2-3 months)
  - Add identity-based scenarios to existing training
  - Include industry-specific examples
- **Technical Controls** (Cost: Medium, Time: 1-2 months)
  - Email monitoring for identity claims
  - Authentication requirements for sensitive requests

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
- **Behavioral Analytics** (Cost: High, Time: 3-6 months)
  - Monitor differential response rates to identity-based communications
  - Requires technical infrastructure investment

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
- **"How do your employees currently handle requests from people claiming to work for partner companies?"**
- **"What's your process when someone contacts IT saying they're a fellow technical professional?"**
- **"How much information about your leadership team can I find online in 5 minutes?"**

### Follow-Up Prompts:
- **If no verification process**: "Can you show me what happens when someone claims to be from [major client/partner]?"
- **If informal process**: "How consistent is this across different departments?"
- **If training exists**: "Does it specifically cover people claiming shared backgrounds?"

### Red Flag Indicators:
- **Immediate compliance** with unverified requests from claimed colleagues
- **Different response times** for "internal" vs external requests without verification
- **Extensive public information** about employee professional backgrounds
- **No awareness** that identity claims need verification

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:
- **Instead of**: "Your employees are easily fooled"
- **Say**: "This creates opportunity for attackers to exploit professional courtesy"
- **Instead of**: "Poor security practices" 
- **Say**: "Opportunity to strengthen identity verification processes"
