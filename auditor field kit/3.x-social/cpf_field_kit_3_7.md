# CPF FIELD KIT 3.7: PEER PRESSURE COMPLIANCE

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each indicator:**

‚ñ° **Team Clustering**: Security violations show patterns where 3+ people from same team violate similar policies within 30 days
‚ñ° **Tool Spread**: Unauthorized software spreads to 5+ team members within 60 days of first adoption
‚ñ° **Reporting Hesitation**: Employees report reluctance to flag security concerns when colleagues appear unconcerned
‚ñ° **New Employee Conformity**: New hires adopt team security shortcuts within first 90 days without formal guidance
‚ñ° **Cross-Team Compromise**: Multi-department projects default to least secure practices for convenience
‚ñ° **Deadline Bypasses**: Teams collectively skip security protocols during high-pressure periods
‚ñ° **Group Justification**: Security violations defended with "everyone does it" or similar group-based reasoning

**Quick Score**: 4+ YES = RED | 2-3 YES = YELLOW | 0-1 YES = GREEN

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
‚ñ° **Incident Reports**: Last 6 months of security violations by department/team
‚ñ° **HR Records**: New employee security training completion and dates
‚ñ° **IT Logs**: Software installation patterns and shadow IT discovery reports
‚ñ° **Project Documentation**: Recent cross-team project security decisions
‚ñ° **Policy Exception Requests**: Formal vs. informal security bypasses

### System Demonstrations
‚ñ° **Show anonymous reporting system** and usage statistics
‚ñ° **Demonstrate security dashboard** team-level metrics
‚ñ° **Review team communication channels** for security discussions
‚ñ° **Display security training tracking** by team and individual

### Key Interviews (15 minutes each)
‚ñ° **IT Security Manager**: Team violation patterns and reporting behaviors
‚ñ° **HR Representative**: New employee security integration process
‚ñ° **Department Manager**: Team security decision-making under pressure
‚ñ° **Recent New Hire**: How they learned actual security practices vs. policy

### Technical Checks
‚ñ° **Correlation analysis**: Same-team violations within 30-day windows
‚ñ° **Software inventory**: Unauthorized tool adoption patterns by team
‚ñ° **Access logs**: Credential sharing or unusual group access patterns
‚ñ° **Communication analysis**: Security-related group conversations

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE**: Review violation clustering analysis

**If** violations show team clustering (3+ people, same team, 30 days) **‚Üí** Continue to RED assessment
**If** isolated violations only **‚Üí** Continue to YELLOW/GREEN assessment

**RED Indicators** (Need 2+ to confirm RED):
- Multiple teams show identical violation patterns monthly
- New employees adopt shortcuts within 60 days consistently
- Anonymous reporting system shows <5 reports per month per 100 employees
- Cross-team projects document security compromises for convenience
- Group justification language appears in >25% of violation explanations

**YELLOW Indicators** (Need 3+ for YELLOW, otherwise GREEN):
- Some team clustering but not consistent pattern
- Occasional group security shortcuts under pressure
- Mixed response to individual security concerns
- New employee security learning mostly informal
- Cross-team security decisions made case-by-case

**GREEN Confirmed** (All must be present):
- Violations are isolated, not team-clustered
- Formal security exception processes used under pressure
- Active support for individuals raising security concerns
- New employee security mentoring is formal and tracked
- Cross-team projects default to highest security standards

- Cost: MEDIUM | Time: 8-12 weeks | Dependencies: HR coordination
- Restructures peer influence toward compliance

**Decision Documentation Requirements**
- Cost: LOW | Time: 6-8 weeks | Dependencies: Workflow system setup
- Creates accountability for group security decisions

### MEDIUM IMPACT / SUPPORTIVE

**Security Buddy System**
- Cost: LOW | Time: 4-6 weeks | Dependencies: HR program management
- Reduces new employee conformity pressure

**Cross-Team Policy Enforcement**
- Cost: HIGH | Time: 12-16 weeks | Dependencies: IAM system overhaul
- Eliminates security negotiation in collaborations

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your most recent security incident involving multiple team members."**
- Follow-up: *"How did the second and third people get involved?"*
- Red flag: *Group coordination without security consultation*

**"How do new employees learn what security practices your teams actually follow?"**
- Follow-up: *"Can you give me a specific recent example?"*
- Red flag: *"They pick it up from watching others"*

**"When teams face tight deadlines, what typically happens to security procedures?"**
- Follow-up: *"Do teams check with security first, or decide as a group?"*
- Red flag: *Group decisions to bypass security*

### Sensitive Topics Script
**For authority/management resistance:**
*"We're seeing this pattern across many organizations - teams naturally want to help each other succeed, which sometimes creates unintended security gaps. Our goal is to channel that team spirit toward security strength."*

**For cultural concerns:**
*"This isn't about individual blame - it's about understanding how team dynamics affect security. Strong teams can be our best security asset when properly supported."*

### Deep Investigation Triggers
- Multiple violations with identical timestamps
- References to "team standards" different from policy
- Reluctance to discuss specific team security practices
- New employee security training completion vs. actual practices gap
