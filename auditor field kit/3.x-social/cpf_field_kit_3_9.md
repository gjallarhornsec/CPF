# üìã CPF INDICATOR 3.9 FIELD KIT: SOCIAL IDENTITY THREATS

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Core Question**: Are employees modifying security behavior to maintain group belonging?

### Binary Assessment Checklist

‚ñ° **Exception Patterns**: Do specific departments request security exceptions more than 2x per quarter?

‚ñ° **Workaround Evidence**: Are there documented informal processes that bypass security controls?

‚ñ° **Mixed Messaging**: Do internal communications contain jokes, complaints, or negative language about security policies?

‚ñ° **Status-Based Handling**: Are security incidents involving senior/respected employees handled differently than others?

‚ñ° **Group Resistance**: Do professional groups (IT, Sales, Exec) show consistent patterns of security policy resistance?

‚ñ° **Peer Learning**: Do new employees learn security practices primarily from colleagues rather than formal training?

‚ñ° **Business Override**: Are security procedures regularly bypassed when client/business pressure exists?

**RED FLAG**: 4+ Yes answers indicate high social identity threat vulnerability

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION GUIDE (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- **Exception logs**: Security policy exceptions from past 12 months, sorted by department
- **Training records**: New employee onboarding security training completion and methods
- **Incident reports**: Internal security incidents involving different employee levels from past 6 months
- **Communication samples**: Recent all-hands meeting notes, team communications mentioning security

### Demonstration Requests
- **"Show me how a new technical hire learns your security practices"**
- **"Walk me through your last security exception approval process"**
- **"Demonstrate how different teams communicate about security requirements"**

### System Checks
‚ñ° Formal exception tracking system exists and is actively used
‚ñ° Security training completion rates by department/role
‚ñ° Incident reporting system logs show consistent usage patterns
‚ñ° Anonymous reporting mechanisms are available and functional

### Interview Targets (15 min each)
- **IT Manager**: Department exception patterns and informal practices
- **HR Representative**: New employee security onboarding process
- **Department Lead** (non-IT): Team attitudes toward security policies
- **Recent New Hire**: Actual vs. formal security learning experience

## üéØ RAPID SCORING MATRIX (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE** ‚Üí Count total exceptions by department over 12 months

**IF** variance between highest/lowest department >50% ‚Üí **YELLOW minimum**

**IF** any department >6 exceptions per quarter ‚Üí **RED**

**THEN** ‚Üí Check incident reporting patterns

**IF** incidents involving senior staff handled informally ‚Üí **YELLOW minimum**

**IF** clear evidence of avoiding reports on respected colleagues ‚Üí **RED**

**THEN** ‚Üí Assess communication tone

**IF** mixed messages about security in meetings/communications ‚Üí **YELLOW minimum**

**IF** systematic mocking or resistance language documented ‚Üí **RED**

**FINAL SCORING**:
- **GREEN (0)**: All formal processes followed, consistent across groups
- **YELLOW (1)**: Some patterns/workarounds but not systematic
- **RED (2)**: Clear group-based resistance patterns documented

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM TIMELINE
**Cost: Medium**
- ‚úÖ Cross-functional security team embedding
- ‚úÖ Graduated exception processes with peer review
- ‚úÖ Professional development integration of security competencies

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
**Cost: High**
- ‚úÖ Cultural change management program
- ‚úÖ Organizational structure redesign to reduce silos
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive performance system integration

### Dependencies
- **Leadership buy-in** required for cultural changes

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"How do different departments typically respond when new security policies are introduced?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Can you give me a specific recent example?"

**"When someone needs to report a security concern about a colleague, what's the typical process?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Has this process been tested recently?"

**"How do new employees actually learn your security practices day-to-day?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Does this differ from what's in the official training?"

### Red Flag Probes
**IF** client mentions "some resistance": **"Which groups show the most resistance and why?"**

**IF** client mentions "informal practices": **"How do these informal practices differ from official policy?"**

**IF** client mentions "senior staff concerns": **"How are these concerns typically resolved?"**

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of**: "Your culture is broken"
- **Say**: "We're seeing opportunities to strengthen security through better group alignment"

- **Instead of**: "People are bypassing security"
- **Say**: "We're identifying ways to make security practices more integrated with daily workflows"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AUDITOR NOTES

### Success Metrics to Propose
- **75% reduction** in routine security exceptions within 90 days
- **Equal reporting rates** for security concerns regardless of employee status within 120 days
- **<10% variance** in compliance rates between departments within 6 months

### Common Pitfalls
- Don't assume malicious intent - most identity-based resistance is unconscious
- Focus on group dynamics, not individual behavior
- Avoid positioning as "culture problem" - frame as "alignment opportunity"

### Escalation Triggers
- **Immediate**: Evidence of systematic credential sharing
- **24 hours**: Clear retaliation against security reporters
- **Weekly**: Documented leadership resistance to security policies

**TOTAL ASSESSMENT TIME**: 22 minutes maximum
