# 📋 INDICATOR 3.2 FIELD KIT: COMMITMENT ESCALATION TRAPS

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Instructions**: Check YES/NO for each item based on observable evidence only.

□ **YES/NO**: Organization has documented processes that automatically expire security exceptions within 90 days  
□ **YES/NO**: Security investment reviews occur at least quarterly with evidence-based discontinuation decisions  
□ **YES/NO**: Vendor access boundaries are monitored with alerts for scope expansion attempts  
□ **YES/NO**: Independent teams (not original decision-makers) conduct periodic access reviews  
□ **YES/NO**: Organization has discontinued at least one security tool/process in past 12 months due to poor performance  
□ **YES/NO**: Exception approval processes require fresh justification for renewals beyond initial period  
□ **YES/NO**: Behavioral analytics detect and alert on escalating request patterns from same sources  

**Immediate Scoring**: 
- 6-7 YES = **Green (0)**
- 4-5 YES = **Yellow (1)** 
- 0-3 YES = **Red (2)**

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
□ **Security exception log** (past 6 months) with approval dates and renewal records  
□ **Vendor access review reports** (most recent quarterly review)  
□ **Security investment portfolio** showing current initiatives and their performance metrics  
□ **Access management system screenshots** showing automatic expiration settings  
□ **Incident reports** mentioning scope escalation or social engineering (past year)  

### System Demonstrations Required
□ **Show access management system** - demonstrate automatic exception expiration  
□ **Display monitoring dashboard** - vendor access patterns and boundary alerts  
□ **Present security portfolio review** - evidence of discontinued initiatives  
□ **Demonstrate approval workflow** - exception renewal process requirements  

### Key Interview Targets
□ **CISO/Security Manager**: Security investment decision processes  
□ **Access Management Lead**: Exception handling and review procedures  
□ **Vendor Relationship Manager**: Access boundary monitoring and escalation handling  
□ **Audit/Compliance Manager**: Independent review processes and findings  

### Critical System Checks
□ **Exception database query**: Count of exceptions >90 days old without renewal  
□ **Vendor access logs**: Evidence of access pattern monitoring and alerting  
□ **Security tool inventory**: Documentation of performance reviews and discontinuations  
□ **Behavioral analytics config**: Escalation pattern detection rules and recent alerts

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Decision Tree - Follow Path Based on Evidence**

**START HERE**: Does organization have automated exception expiration system?
- **YES** → Go to Path A
- **NO** → **RED (2)** - Stop here

**Path A**: Are security investments reviewed quarterly with discontinuation examples?
- **YES** → Go to Path B  
- **NO** → **YELLOW (1)** - Stop here

**Path B**: Are there independent access review teams with authority to override original decisions?
- **YES** → **GREEN (0)** - Stop here
- **NO** → **YELLOW (1)** - Stop here

**Override Conditions** (Force RED regardless of above):
- More than 20% of exceptions become permanent without review
- No security initiatives discontinued in past 12 months despite audit findings
- Evidence of vendor access expansion without formal approval process
- Repeated escalation patterns from same sources without additional controls

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Walk me through your most recent security exception request. How long did it take to approve, and what's the renewal process?"**

*Listen for*: Automatic expiration, renewal requirements, permanent exceptions

**"Can you show me an example of a security tool or process you've stopped using in the past year? What drove that decision?"**

*Listen for*: Evidence-based discontinuation, resistance to change, sunk cost reasoning

### Follow-up Prompts
**If they mention exceptions**: *"How do you prevent temporary exceptions from becoming permanent practices?"*

**If they mention vendor access**: *"What happens when a vendor requests expanded access beyond their original scope?"*

**If they mention security investments**: *"How do you measure the effectiveness of ongoing security initiatives?"*

### Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation
- **"We've always done it this way"** → Probe for commitment escalation patterns
- **"Too much invested to change now"** → Explore sunk cost decision-making
- **"The vendor is trusted"** → Investigate access boundary management
- **"It's just a temporary exception"** → Examine exception tracking and sunset processes

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
**Instead of**: "You're falling for commitment escalation traps"  
**Say**: "Let's review your processes for adapting security approaches based on new information"

**Instead of**: "This vendor relationship is compromising your security"  
**Say**: "How do you ensure vendor access stays aligned with business requirements over time?"
