# INDICATOR 3.4: Liking-based Trust Override

## CONTEXT

Employees bypass security protocols when they like or feel connected to the person making requests. This psychological vulnerability occurs when positive emotions toward requesters override critical thinking and security procedures. Organizations see 300-400% higher success rates in social engineering attacks when attackers first build rapport and establish likeable personas before making security-compromising requests.

## ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

**Q1: Verification Consistency**
How often do employees apply the same identity verification steps regardless of whether they know and like the person making the request? 
*Tell us your specific example of how verification works for both known and unknown requesters.*

**Q2: Social Media Interaction Policy**
What's your policy regarding employees engaging with unknown individuals on professional platforms like LinkedIn who express interest in your company or industry?
*Give us a recent example of how an employee handled an unsolicited professional connection request.*

**Q3: Access Request Patterns**
When someone builds a relationship with your employees over multiple interactions (emails, calls, meetings), what additional verification steps are required before granting access or information?
*Describe your process when a "friendly vendor" or "potential partner" requests sensitive information after several positive interactions.*

**Q4: Incident Reporting for Trusted Sources**
How often do employees report suspicious requests when they come from people they like or have built relationships with?
*Tell us about a recent incident where an employee had to choose between helping someone they liked and following security protocols.*

**Q5: Training Simulation Results**
When you test employees with social engineering simulations, how do success rates differ between likeable/friendly attackers versus neutral or obviously suspicious ones?
*Share your specific results comparing "friendly" versus "cold" social engineering test scenarios.*

**Q6: Relationship-Building Attack Recognition**
What training do employees receive to recognize when someone might be building rapport specifically to later exploit that relationship for security access?
*Give us an example of how you teach employees to identify gradual relationship-building attacks.*

**Q7: Customer Service Security Balance**
How do customer-facing employees balance being helpful and building relationships while maintaining security protocols?
*Describe a specific situation where customer service staff had to choose between being helpful to a liked customer and following security procedures.*

## SCORING CRITERIA

**Green (0): Low Vulnerability**
- Identical verification procedures applied regardless of relationship status
- Clear policies limiting social media professional engagement
- Mandatory additional verification for relationship-based requests
- Regular incident reports from trusted source interactions
- Training specifically addresses rapport-building attacks
- Customer service has clear security override procedures

**Yellow (1): Moderate Vulnerability**
- Verification procedures exist but inconsistently applied based on relationships
- Some social media guidance but not comprehensive
- Additional verification suggested but not mandatory
- Occasional incident reports from trusted sources
- General social engineering training without specific rapport-building focus
- Customer service balances security and service case-by-case

**Red (2): High Vulnerability**
- Verification procedures relaxed or skipped for known/liked individuals
- No policy on professional social media engagement
- No additional verification for relationship-based requests
- Rare or no incident reports involving trusted sources
- No training on recognizing rapport-building attacks
- Customer service prioritizes helpfulness over security protocols

## RISK SCENARIOS

**Multi-Stage Spear Phishing Campaign**
Attacker researches employee social media, engages in friendly professional conversations over weeks, builds rapport around shared interests, then requests credential reset or system access. Success rate increases 65% with rapport-building phase versus cold attacks.

**Conference/Event Network Exploitation**
Attacker attends industry events, builds genuine relationships with key employees over multiple interactions, maintains contact, then exploits these relationships months later for internal access, vendor impersonation, or sensitive information requests.

**Business Email Compromise Evolution**
Modern BEC attacks include 3-4 weeks of benign relationship-building emails discussing industry trends, shared challenges, or mutual connections before introducing fraudulent wire transfer or credential requests, bypassing traditional technical email filters.

**Insider Threat Recruitment**
External actors spend months building personal relationships with employees facing financial stress or job dissatisfaction, gradually transitioning from emotional support to requests for internal information or system access, exploiting trust and obligation.

## SOLUTION CATALOG

**1. Relationship-Blind Verification Protocol**
Implement mandatory verification steps that must be completed regardless of requester relationship status. System enforces verification completion before access is granted, removing human discretion for "trusted" sources.

**2. Social Media Monitoring and Training**
Deploy tools that monitor employee professional social media for unusual engagement patterns. Provide specific training on professional networking red flags, including rapid relationship-building attempts and information-gathering conversations.

**3. Multi-Interaction Request Flagging**
Implement system that automatically flags requests coming after multiple positive interactions (3+ emails, calls, or meetings). Requires additional approval level and documentation of business justification for all flagged requests.

**4. Rapport-Building Attack Simulations**
Conduct quarterly social engineering tests using likeable personas who build relationships over 2-4 weeks before making security requests. Track performance differences between "cold" and "warm" social engineering attempts.

**5. Customer Service Security Checkpoints**
Establish mandatory security checkpoints in customer service workflows that cannot be bypassed regardless of customer relationship or satisfaction concerns. Implement escalation procedures when customers resist security protocols.

**6. Trusted Source Incident Reporting System**
Create separate, anonymous reporting channel specifically for suspicious activities from liked or trusted sources. Include training that emphasizes reporting suspicious behavior doesn't damage relationships but protects both parties.

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**Protocol Documentation Review**
- Request written verification procedures
- Confirm procedures are identical for all requesters
- Verify no relationship-based exceptions exist
- Check audit logs for procedure compliance

**Training Material Assessment**
- Review social engineering training content
- Confirm rapport-building attack scenarios included
- Validate customer service security training
- Examine simulation exercise results and trends

**System Configuration Audit**
- Verify access control systems enforce verification
- Check social media monitoring tool deployment
- Confirm flagging system operational for multi-interaction requests
- Validate incident reporting system accessibility

**Policy Implementation Evidence**
- Interview employees about real-world application
- Review recent incident reports involving trusted sources
- Examine customer service escalation records
- Analyze verification compliance metrics

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Verification Compliance Rate**
Measure percentage of security procedures completed regardless of requester relationship status. Target 95% compliance across all interaction types. Monitor monthly through system logs and spot audits.

**Incident Reporting from Trusted Sources**
Track number of reports involving suspicious activity from liked or trusted individuals. Target 200% increase in first 6 months as awareness improves, then stabilize at new baseline.

**Social Engineering Simulation Performance Parity**
Measure success rate difference between "likeable" and "neutral" social engineering tests. Target reducing performance gap from typical 65% difference to under 15% within 90 days.
