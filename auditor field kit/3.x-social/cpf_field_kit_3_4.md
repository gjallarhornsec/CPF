## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Instructions:** Check YES/NO for each item based on immediate evidence

| # | Assessment Item | YES | NO |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Written verification procedures** exist that explicitly state "same process regardless of relationship status" | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 2 | **System-enforced verification** that cannot be bypassed based on user discretion | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 3 | **Social media engagement policy** exists for professional platforms (LinkedIn, etc.) | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 4 | **Additional verification requirements** documented for multi-interaction requests | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 5 | **Incident reports from past 6 months** include suspicious activity from "trusted" sources | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 6 | **Training materials** specifically address rapport-building/relationship-based attacks | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 7 | **Customer service procedures** include mandatory security checkpoints that cannot be skipped | ‚òê | ‚òê |

**Quick Score:** Count YES answers = ___/7

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Identity verification procedures** (written policies)
- [ ] **Social media engagement guidelines** for employees
- [ ] **Customer service security protocols** 
- [ ] **Training materials** on social engineering (past 12 months)
- [ ] **Incident reports** involving trusted/known sources (past 6 months)
- [ ] **Access request logs** showing verification steps completed

### System Demonstrations Needed
- [ ] **"Show me how you verify identity"** - walk through actual process
- [ ] **"What happens if someone skips verification?"** - test system enforcement
- [ ] **"How do you handle requests from existing customers?"** - observe differences
- [ ] **"Demonstrate the incident reporting system"** - check accessibility

### Key Interviews (15 minutes each)
- [ ] **Customer Service Representative** - "How do you balance being helpful with security?"
- [ ] **HR Personnel** - "What happens when someone you know requests information?"
- [ ] **IT Support Staff** - "How do you verify identity for familiar users?"

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Access control logs** - look for verification bypasses
- [ ] **Email security settings** - check for relationship-based exceptions
- [ ] **Social media monitoring tools** - verify deployment status

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE:** Count YES answers from Quick Assessment

**7 YES = GREEN (0 points)**
- All controls present and documented
- Consistent verification regardless of relationships
- Training addresses rapport-building attacks

**4-6 YES = YELLOW (1 point)**  
- Basic controls exist but gaps in consistency
- Some relationship-based exceptions allowed
- General training without specific rapport focus

**0-3 YES = RED (2 points)**
- Missing critical verification controls
- Procedures routinely bypassed for "trusted" sources
- No training on relationship-based attacks

### Verification Questions (if scoring unclear)
- **"Can employees skip verification for people they know?"** ‚Üí If YES = RED
- **"Do you test employees with 'friendly' social engineering?"** ‚Üí If NO = YELLOW minimum
- **"Are customer service staff allowed to bend rules for upset customers?"** ‚Üí If YES = YELLOW minimum

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

| Priority | Solution | Impact | Cost | Time | Dependencies |
|----------|----------|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **HIGH** | System-enforced verification protocols | HIGH | LOW | 30 days | IT approval |
| **HIGH** | Rapport-building attack simulation training | HIGH | MED | 60 days | Training budget |
| **MEDIUM** | Social media monitoring implementation | MED | MED | 90 days | Tool procurement |
| **MEDIUM** | Customer service security checkpoints | MED | LOW | 45 days | Process redesign |
| **LOW** | Anonymous reporting system for trusted sources | LOW | LOW | 60 days | HR coordination |

### Quick Implementation Wins (< 30 days)
- [ ] **Policy update** requiring identical verification for all requesters
- [ ] **System configuration** to enforce verification completion
- [ ] **Staff reminder** about existing protocols

### Long-term Improvements (60+ days)  
- [ ] **Comprehensive training program** on relationship-based attacks
- [ ] **Social media monitoring tools** deployment
- [ ] **Advanced simulation exercises** with rapport-building scenarios

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"I'd like to understand how your team handles requests from people they know versus strangers. Can you walk me through your verification process?"**

### Follow-up Prompts
- **If they mention exceptions:** "In what situations would someone skip those steps?"
- **If they describe informal processes:** "Is this documented anywhere?"
- **If they emphasize trust:** "How do you balance trust with security requirements?"

### Red Flag Indicators
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"We know our customers/vendors"** - suggests verification bypass
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"It depends on the person"** - inconsistent procedures  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"We don't want to offend people"** - relationship over security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Common sense applies"** - subjective decision-making

### Sensitive Topic Language
- **Instead of:** "Your employees are vulnerable to manipulation"
- **Say:** "We're looking at how to maintain good relationships while ensuring consistent security"

- **Instead of:** "People can't be trusted"  
- **Say:** "Even well-intentioned people can be targeted by sophisticated attackers"
