# üìã CPF INDICATOR 7.5 FIELD KIT: FREEZE RESPONSE PARALYSIS

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Average incident response time exceeds 2 hours for urgent security incidents
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security decisions are delayed when primary decision-makers are unavailable  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Team struggles to process alerts when volume increases 3x normal levels
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Complex incidents (3+ attack types) take over 8 hours to determine response strategy
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Multiple authority conflicts occur during security incidents with no clear resolution process
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: No formal tracking exists for decision time vs. action time during incidents
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Less than 70% of incidents meeting escalation criteria are escalated within defined timeframes

**Score**: Count YES answers = ___/7

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
‚ñ° **Incident response procedures** showing decision timeframes

‚ñ° **Last 10 security incident reports** with timestamps
‚ñ° **Alert management system configurations**
‚ñ° **Training records** for stress/decision-making scenarios
‚ñ° **Escalation tracking reports** from past 6 months

### Demonstrations to Request
‚ñ° **"Show me your incident response dashboard"** - observe decision tracking
‚ñ° **"Walk through your last complex security incident"** - identify delay points
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate authority backup during off-hours"** - test delegation system
‚ñ° **"Show alert handling during volume spikes"** - observe triage process

### System Checks to Perform
‚ñ° **Review alert volume statistics** for past 3 months
‚ñ° **Check decision support tools** availability and usage logs
‚ñ° **Verify 24/7 authority coverage** in scheduling systems
‚ñ° **Test automated escalation triggers** functionality

### Interview Targets
‚ñ° **SOC Manager** - authority structures and escalation patterns
‚ñ° **Senior Security Analyst** - decision-making challenges and delays
‚ñ° **On-call Personnel** - off-hours decision authority experience
‚ñ° **Incident Commander** - complex incident decision processes

### If 2-4 YES answers ‚Üí **YELLOW (Moderate Vulnerability)**  
- Average response 30-120 min for urgent incidents
- Some authority gaps during off-hours
- Alert triage struggles with volume spikes
- 70-90% incidents escalated within timeframes

### If 5-7 YES answers ‚Üí **RED (High Vulnerability)**
- Average response >120 min for urgent incidents  
- Authority confusion common
- Alert spikes cause significant backlogs
- <70% incidents escalated within timeframes

**Final Score**: ‚ñ° GREEN ‚ñ° YELLOW ‚ñ° RED

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your last security incident that took longer than expected to resolve."**
- *Follow-up*: "What specific factors caused delays in decision-making?"
- *Red flag*: Extended analysis phases without corresponding action

**"What happens when your security manager is unavailable during an incident?"**  
- *Follow-up*: "Can you give me a recent example?"
- *Red flag*: Delays waiting for unavailable decision-makers

**"How does your team handle alert volume spikes?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Tell me about the last time alerts increased significantly"  
- *Red flag*: Alert spikes correlate with missed critical incidents

### Sensitivity Areas

**When discussing decision delays:**
- Use: *"We're looking at optimizing incident response efficiency"*
- Avoid: *"Your team seems paralyzed during incidents"*

**When addressing authority confusion:**
- Use: *"Let's clarify the decision-making structure"*  
- Avoid: *"There's confusion about who's in charge"*

**When noting training gaps:**
- Use: *"Enhanced decision-making training could be beneficial"*
- Avoid: *"Your staff aren't prepared for stress"*

### Probing Questions for Incomplete Answers

- *"Can you walk me through the timeline of that incident?"*
- *"Who made the key decisions and when?"*
- *"What would have helped speed up the response?"*
- *"How do you track decision-making effectiveness?"*
