□ **YES** / □ **NO** - Security tasks have named individual owners (not just team assignments)

□ **YES** / □ **NO** - Security alerts are sent to specific individuals rather than groups/teams

□ **YES** / □ **NO** - Individual security performance metrics exist and are tracked

□ **YES** / □ **NO** - Shared security accounts have individual activity attribution/logging

□ **YES** / □ **NO** - Security incident response has clear individual accountability roles

□ **YES** / □ **NO** - Security documentation has named individual owners for updates/maintenance

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] **Security task assignment records** (last 30 days)
- [ ] **Individual security performance scorecards** or metrics
- [ ] **Security alert distribution lists** and response logs
- [ ] **Shared account access logs** with user attribution
- [ ] **Job descriptions** with specific individual security responsibilities
- [ ] **Security training completion reports** by individual
- [ ] **Incident response procedure** with individual role definitions

### System Demonstrations:
- [ ] **"Show me how security alerts are assigned"** - check for individual vs. group targeting
- [ ] **"Walk through your last security incident response"** - identify individual accountability
- [ ] **"Demonstrate shared account monitoring"** - verify individual attribution capability
- [ ] **"Show security task tracking system"** - confirm individual ownership visibility

### Interview Targets:
- [ ] **Security Team Lead** - ask about individual vs. team responsibility structure
- [ ] **SOC Analysts** (2-3 individuals) - assess individual accountability awareness
- [ ] **IT Manager** - verify individual security performance tracking
- [ ] **Incident Response Coordinator** - confirm individual role clarity

### System Checks:
- [ ] **SIEM alert configuration** - individual vs. group notifications
- [ ] **Task management system** - individual assignment capability
- [ ] **Shared service accounts** - individual activity logging
- [ ] **Security awareness platform** - individual tracking functionality

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**START HERE:** Are security tasks assigned to named individuals?

- **YES** → Go to A
- **NO** → **RED SCORE**

**A:** Are individual security metrics tracked and reviewed?

- **YES** → Go to B  
- **NO** → Go to C

**B:** Do security alerts go to specific individuals with accountability?

- **YES** → **GREEN SCORE**
- **NO** → **YELLOW SCORE**

**C:** Is there any individual accountability for shared security resources?

- **YES** → **YELLOW SCORE**
- **NO** → **RED SCORE**

### Objective Thresholds:
- **GREEN:** >80% security tasks individually assigned + individual metrics + individual alert ownership
- **YELLOW:** 50-80% individual assignment OR partial metrics OR mixed alert distribution
- **RED:** <50% individual assignment + no individual metrics + group-only alerts

## 🔧 SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Individual Alert Assignment** - Configure security tools for individual notifications
- **Named Task Ownership** - Assign specific individuals to existing security tasks
- **Individual Response Tracking** - Track who responds to security alerts/incidents
- *Cost: LOW | Timeline: 1-4 weeks*

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM 
- **Individual Security Scorecards** - Implement personal security performance metrics
- **Shared Account Attribution** - Deploy individual logging for shared security credentials
- **Job Description Updates** - Add specific individual security responsibilities
- *Cost: MEDIUM | Timeline: 2-6 months*

### MEDIUM IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Security Documentation Ownership** - Assign individual owners to policies/procedures
- **Individual Training Tracking** - Separate individual from team training metrics
- **Accountability Reporting** - Monthly individual security contribution reviews
- *Cost: LOW | Timeline: 2-8 weeks*

### Dependencies:
- **Management Buy-in** required for individual accountability changes
- **HR Coordination** needed for job description/performance metric updates
- **IT Systems** may require configuration changes for individual tracking

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"When your security team gets an alert, who specifically is responsible for responding?"**
- *Follow-up: "How do you ensure someone actually takes action?"*

**"Can you show me how you track individual security performance vs. team performance?"**
- *Follow-up: "What happens if an individual consistently underperforms on security?"*

**"Walk me through your last security incident - who was individually accountable for each step?"**
- *Follow-up: "How did you ensure no one assumed someone else was handling it?"*

### Red Flag Indicators:
- **Responses like "the team handles it"** without naming specific individuals
- **Inability to show individual security metrics** or accountability measures
- **Examples of security tasks assigned to groups** without individual ownership
- **Shared accounts without individual attribution** or monitoring

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:
- **Instead of "social loafing"** → *"ensuring individual accountability in security tasks"*
- **Instead of "people slack off"** → *"optimizing individual security engagement"*
- **Instead of "your team is failing"** → *"opportunities to enhance individual responsibility"*

### Probing Questions:
**"How do you prevent security tasks from falling through the cracks?"**
**"What happens when multiple people think someone else is handling a security issue?"**
**"How do you measure individual contributions to your security posture?"**
