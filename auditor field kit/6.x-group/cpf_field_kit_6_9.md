# üìã CPF FIELD KIT 6.9: ORGANIZATIONAL SPLITTING

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Recent security incidents automatically attributed to external attackers without internal investigation
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Different security standards exist for executives vs. regular employees  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Privileged users (admins, executives, long-term staff) have minimal activity monitoring
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security budget allocation <30% focused on insider threat detection
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Frequent security policy exceptions granted to "trusted" personnel
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Established vendor relationships rarely reassessed for security (>2 years)
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Zero trust principles rejected or major exceptions exist for certain roles

**Quick Score**: 0-2 YES = Green | 3-4 YES = Yellow | 5-7 YES = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
‚ñ° **Security incident reports** (last 6 months) - check attribution patterns
‚ñ° **Security budget breakdown** - external vs. internal threat spending
‚ñ° **Access control matrix** - different standards by role
‚ñ° **Policy exception log** - frequency and justifications
‚ñ° **Vendor security assessments** - dates of last reviews

### System Demonstrations
‚ñ° **"Show me privileged user monitoring"** - what exists for executives/admins
‚ñ° **"Walk through incident response process"** - how root cause determined
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate access approval workflow"** - exceptions for senior staff
‚ñ° **"Show vendor access controls"** - how trusted partners are managed

### Key Interviews
‚ñ° **CISO/Security Leader**: Budget allocation rationale, incident patterns
‚ñ° **IT Administrator**: Monitoring capabilities, access exceptions  
‚ñ° **Compliance Officer**: Policy exception frequency and approval process
‚ñ° **Incident Response Lead**: Recent incident investigation approaches

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE:** Does organization have insider threat monitoring for ALL privileged users?

**NO** ‚Üí Check budget allocation:
- <20% insider threat focus = **RED**
- 20-29% insider threat focus = **YELLOW**

**YES** ‚Üí Check incident attribution:
- Always external attribution = **RED**  
- Mixed attribution patterns = **YELLOW**
- Comprehensive investigations = **GREEN**

**Policy Exceptions Override:**
- Frequent exceptions for "trusted" staff = Upgrade risk by one level
- Uniform policy enforcement = Maintain current level

**Final Check:**
- Zero trust implementation comprehensive = **GREEN**
- Zero trust partial with justified exceptions = **YELLOW** 
- Zero trust rejected or major trust-based exceptions = **RED**

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"When you had your last security incident, how did you determine if it was an inside or outside job?"**
- *Follow-up*: "What evidence did you look for internally?"
- *Red flag*: Immediate external attribution without investigation

**"Walk me through how a senior executive gets access to a new system."**
- *Follow-up*: "Are there any differences from how regular employees get access?"
- *Red flag*: Different standards, expedited approval, minimal verification

**"What percentage of your security budget goes toward monitoring internal user behavior?"**
- *Follow-up*: "How do you monitor your privileged users and administrators?"
- *Red flag*: <20% budget allocation, no privileged user monitoring

### Sensitive Topic Handling
**"We're looking at balanced security approaches that protect against all threat vectors..."**
- Avoid: "insider threat" language initially
- Frame: "comprehensive security posture"
- Emphasize: "industry best practices" and "regulatory expectations"

### Probing Follow-ups
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "How often does that happen?"
- "Who makes those decisions?"
- "What would trigger an exception to that policy?"

## üö® AUDITOR ALERTS

### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Escalation
- **Complete lack of insider threat monitoring**
- **No investigation of internal factors in recent incidents** 
- **Executive exemptions from all security controls**
- **Vendor access never reviewed or monitored**

### Common Client Pushback
*"We trust our people"* ‚Üí "Trust with verification is the industry standard"
*"External threats are the real risk"* ‚Üí "Comprehensive protection addresses all vectors"
*"This would hurt our culture"* ‚Üí "Balanced security actually strengthens culture"

### Assessment Quality Checks
- Did you see actual monitoring systems, not just policies?
- Did you review real incident reports, not just procedures?
- Did you verify budget numbers, not just estimates?
- Did you test access controls, not just documentation?
