# INDICATOR 6.6: Dependency Group Assumptions

## CONTEXT

Organizations experiencing dependency group assumptions unconsciously seek "silver bullet" security solutions and over-rely on specific vendors, tools, or personnel for protection. This creates dangerous single points of failure where attackers can exploit the organization's blind trust in their chosen protective figures. When security responsibility is psychologically transferred to external entities, internal vigilance and critical thinking deteriorate, making organizations vulnerable to vendor impersonation attacks, fraudulent security solutions, and supply chain compromises.

## ASSESSMENT

**Question 1: Vendor Concentration**
What percentage of your annual cybersecurity budget goes to your top security vendor? Include all services, licenses, and support contracts from that single vendor.

**Question 2: Decision Authority**
When your primary security tool alerts or fails, who makes the decision about how to respond? How often do security decisions require approval from senior leadership before action can be taken?

**Question 3: Vendor Questioning Process**
How frequently does your organization formally review and challenge the effectiveness of your main security vendors? Tell us about your most recent vendor performance audit and what changes resulted from it.

**Question 4: Internal vs External Response**
When a security incident occurs, what's your first response: engage internal team problem-solving or immediately contact external vendors/consultants? Give us a specific example from a recent incident.

**Question 5: Security Solution Evaluation**
Describe your process for evaluating new security tools before purchase. How many solutions do you typically compare, and what evidence do you require beyond vendor demonstrations?

**Question 6: Key Personnel Dependencies**
If your CISO or primary security contact was unavailable for two weeks, how would security decisions be made? Who has the knowledge and authority to maintain security operations?

**Question 7: Backup and Redundancy**
For your most critical security tool, what backup or alternative solution would you use if it failed completely? Tell us about the last time you tested these backup procedures.

## SCORING

**Green (0): Distributed Security Approach**
- Security budget spread across multiple vendors (no single vendor >30%)
- Multiple staff authorized to make routine security decisions
- Quarterly vendor performance reviews with documented improvements
- Internal team attempts problem-solving before external consultation
- Systematic evaluation comparing 3+ solutions with proof-of-concept testing
- Documented succession plan for key security personnel
- Tested backup solutions for critical security tools

**Yellow (1): Moderate Dependency Indicators**
- Single vendor receives 30-50% of security budget
- Most security decisions require senior approval but multiple people can approve
- Annual vendor reviews conducted but limited changes result
- Mixed approach: some internal problem-solving, frequent external consultation
- Limited evaluation process comparing 2-3 solutions
- Some cross-training exists but gaps in key knowledge areas
- Backup solutions identified but rarely tested

**Red (2): High Dependency Vulnerability**
- Single vendor receives >50% of security budget
- Only 1-2 people authorized to make security decisions
- Vendor reviews infrequent or superficial with no resulting changes
- Immediate external consultation is standard response to any security issue
- Minimal evaluation: typically accept vendor recommendations without comparison
- Single point of failure in security knowledge/authority
- No viable backup for critical security tools or untested alternatives

## RISK SCENARIOS

**Vendor Impersonation Attack**: Attacker impersonates trusted security vendor via email or phone, requesting urgent access "to address critical vulnerabilities." Organizations with high dependency scores comply without verification, granting access to critical systems.

**False Authority Exploitation**: During security incidents, attackers position themselves as emergency consultants or experts offering immediate help. Dependency-oriented organizations bypass normal vetting procedures and grant extensive access to resolve the "crisis."

**Silver Bullet Solution Scam**: Fraudulent vendors target organizations seeking comprehensive security solutions, selling ineffective tools by exploiting the organization's desire for complete protection. High dependency organizations skip due diligence and make large investments in worthless solutions.

**Supply Chain Compromise**: Attackers infiltrate the trusted vendor that dependency-oriented organizations rely on heavily. Because these organizations resist questioning or monitoring their protective figures, malicious code or unauthorized access goes undetected for extended periods.

## SOLUTION CATALOG

**Solution 1: Vendor Portfolio Diversification**
Implement a policy requiring no single vendor to exceed 40% of security budget. Create a formal vendor diversification plan with timeline for redistribution of services across multiple providers. Establish competitive bidding requirements for contracts over specified thresholds.

**Solution 2: Distributed Decision Authority Matrix**
Document authorization levels for different security decisions, ensuring multiple personnel can approve routine security responses. Create clear escalation procedures that don't create single points of failure. Implement deputy/backup authorization for all critical security roles.

**Solution 3: Quarterly Vendor Performance Reviews**
Establish standardized vendor assessment criteria including security effectiveness metrics, incident response performance, and cost-benefit analysis. Require vendors to demonstrate measurable improvements in security posture. Document specific actions taken based on review findings.

**Solution 4: Internal Security Response Protocols**
Develop "internal first" incident response procedures requiring 30-minute internal assessment before external consultation (except for declared emergencies). Create decision trees for when external help is appropriate. Train staff in basic incident response to reduce external dependence.

**Solution 5: Security Solution Evaluation Framework**
Implement standardized evaluation requiring comparison of minimum 3 vendors, proof-of-concept testing, and reference checks before purchase. Create evaluation criteria focused on objective security improvements rather than vendor promises. Require documented justification for single-vendor selections.

**Solution 6: Backup Security Operations Plan**
Document alternative procedures for each critical security function if primary tools fail. Test backup solutions quarterly with documented results. Maintain current contact lists for alternative vendors and ensure staff know backup procedures.
