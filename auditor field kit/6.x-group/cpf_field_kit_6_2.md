## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 min)

**Circle YES or NO for each question:**

1. **Are most major security decisions made by committees/groups (4+ people)?**
   - YES / NO
   - *Evidence: Meeting invites, decision logs, org charts*

2. **Do groups discuss risks together WITHOUT collecting individual assessments first?**
   - YES / NO
   - *Evidence: Meeting agendas, pre-work templates*

3. **Do security meetings regularly result in riskier decisions than originally planned?**
   - YES / NO
   - *Evidence: Initial vs final proposals, scope creep docs*

4. **Are people reluctant to raise security concerns during group meetings?**
   - YES / NO
   - *Evidence: Meeting minutes, dissent records*

5. **During emergencies, do groups routinely bypass normal security controls?**
   - YES / NO
   - *Evidence: Incident reports, emergency overrides*

6. **Is there NO systematic tracking of group decision outcomes?**
   - YES / NO
   - *Evidence: Follow-up reports, success metrics*

7. **When group decisions fail, is accountability unclear or diffused?**
   - YES / NO
   - *Evidence: Post-incident reviews, responsibility matrices*

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 min)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] **Meeting minutes** from last 3 security committee meetings
- [ ] **Decision logs** showing individual vs group decisions
- [ ] **Risk assessment templates** used before group meetings
- [ ] **Emergency response procedures** and override records
- [ ] **Post-incident reports** from last 12 months
- [ ] **Accountability matrices** for major security decisions

### Demonstrations to Request:
- [ ] **"Walk me through your last major security decision"**
- [ ] **"Show me how you handle security concerns in meetings"**
- [ ] **"Demonstrate your emergency decision process"**
- [ ] **"Show me how you track group decision outcomes"**

### System Checks to Perform:
- [ ] **Review decision tracking systems** for group vs individual patterns
- [ ] **Check meeting scheduling systems** for committee frequency
- [ ] **Examine change management logs** for emergency approvals
- [ ] **Analyze incident systems** for root cause attribution

### Interview Targets (Roles):
- [ ] **Security Committee Chair** - decision patterns
- [ ] **Risk Manager** - assessment processes  
- [ ] **Incident Response Lead** - emergency decisions
- [ ] **Change Manager** - approval patterns
- [ ] **Individual Security Analyst** - group vs solo preferences

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 min)

### Decision Tree:

**If 0-1 YES answers:** ‚Üí **GREEN (Low Risk)**
- Individual decisions dominate
- Strong accountability present

**If 2-4 YES answers:** ‚Üí **YELLOW (Moderate Risk)** 
- Mixed decision patterns
- Some accountability gaps

**If 5-7 YES answers:** ‚Üí **RED (High Risk)**
- Group decisions dominate
- Diffused accountability

### Risk Indicators by Score:

**GREEN:** Decisions maintain individual accountability even in groups
**YELLOW:** Some risky shift present but contained
**RED:** Systematic risky shift with clear vulnerability patterns

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 min)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION:

**üü¢ Individual Risk Documentation (Cost: LOW)**
- Require written individual risk assessments 24hrs before group meetings
- Template-based approach, minimal training needed
- **Dependency:** Meeting facilitation process

**üü¢ Cooling-Off Periods (Cost: LOW)** 
- 48-hour delay for high-risk group decisions
- Simple policy change with clear triggers
- **Dependency:** Risk threshold definitions

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM TIMELINE:

**üü° Devil's Advocate Roles (Cost: MEDIUM)**
- Rotating assignments for risk challenge responsibilities
- Requires training and cultural change management
- **Dependency:** Protection protocols for dissenting voices

**üü° Decision Outcome Tracking (Cost: MEDIUM)**
- Quarterly reviews comparing predicted vs actual results
- Dashboard development and process integration
- **Dependency:** Data collection systems

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM:

**üî¥ Individual Accountability Mapping (Cost: HIGH)**
- Specific responsibility assignments within group decisions
- Performance metrics tied to decision outcomes
- **Dependency:** HR systems integration, cultural transformation

**üî¥ Emergency Decision Protocols (Cost: HIGH)**
- Tiered response maintaining risk assessment under pressure
- Pre-approved playbooks with built-in safeguards
- **Dependency:** Crisis management process redesign

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 min)

### Opening Questions:
**"Tell me about your most recent major security decision - who was involved and how did you make it?"**

**Follow-up Prompts:**
- *If group decision:* "How did individual opinions compare to the final decision?"
- *If individual decision:* "When do you typically use groups vs individuals for security decisions?"

### Probing Questions:
**"How often do your security meetings end up with riskier approaches than originally planned?"**

**Follow-up Prompts:**
- *If "often":* "Can you give me a specific example?"
- *If "rarely":* "What prevents risk escalation in your groups?"

### Red Flag Indicators:
- **"We trust our team's judgment"** (without process description)
- **"Everyone agrees pretty quickly"** (suppressed dissent)
- **"We have to move fast"** (bypassed controls)
- **"It's hard to say who decided"** (diffused accountability)

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:
- **Instead of:** "Your groups make risky decisions"
- **Say:** "How do you ensure group decisions align with individual risk assessments?"

- **Instead of:** "People don't speak up"
- **Say:** "What's your process for capturing dissenting views in meetings?"
