## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 min)

**Instructions**: Mark YES/NO for each question. All questions must be answered based on observable evidence only.

**‚ñ° Q1**: Can client name the specific person responsible for initial security incident response within 15 seconds?
- **YES** = Named individual with contact info immediately provided
- **NO** = Team/department mentioned OR delays identifying specific person

**‚ñ° Q2**: Are security policy exceptions approved by a named individual (not committee) within documented timeframes?
- **YES** = Single decision-maker with signature/timestamp evidence
- **NO** = Committee approval OR undefined timeframes OR no evidence

**‚ñ° Q3**: Do critical security systems have individual (not team) sign-off on weekly monitoring reports?
- **YES** = Named person signatures on recent reports
- **NO** = Team signatures OR missing signatures OR no recent reports

**‚ñ° Q4**: Are security responsibilities maintained during staff absences with named backup individuals?
- **YES** = Written backup assignments with specific names
- **NO** = General team coverage OR no backup documentation

**‚ñ° Q5**: Do multi-department security projects assign deliverables to named individuals (not departments)?
- **YES** = Project documentation shows individual names for each task
- **NO** = Department assignments OR unclear individual accountability

**‚ñ° Q6**: Is security training compliance tracked and enforced at individual level?
- **YES** = Individual completion records with follow-up evidence
- **NO** = Group metrics OR no individual tracking OR no follow-up

**‚ñ° Q7**: Does vendor security oversight have a named individual owner (not shared responsibility)?
- **YES** = Specific person identified with recent oversight documentation

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 min)

### Decision Tree
**IF 6-7 YES answers** ‚Üí **GREEN (0 points)**
- Strong individual accountability in place
- Low risk of security gaps due to diffused responsibility

**IF 3-5 YES answers** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1 point)**  
- Mixed accountability signals
- Moderate risk during staff changes or high-stress periods

**IF 0-2 YES answers** ‚Üí **RED (2 points)**
- Diffused group responsibility
- High risk of critical security tasks falling through cracks

### Objective Thresholds
- **Individual Response Time**: <15 minutes to identify specific responsible person
- **Documentation Quality**: Named individuals (not teams/departments) in 80%+ of security processes  
- **Backup Coverage**: Written assignments for 100% of critical security roles
- **Approval Authority**: Single decision-makers for 90%+ of security exceptions

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 min)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION (Do First)
**‚ñ°** **Individual Security Ownership Matrix** - Cost: LOW
- Map every security process to specific individuals
- Include primary, backup, and escalation contacts
- Dependencies: Security team time only

**‚ñ°** **Emergency Contact Verification** - Cost: LOW  
- Test all security emergency contacts reach specific individuals
- Update outdated contact information
- Dependencies: None

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM (Plan For)
**‚ñ°** **Security Accountability Dashboard** - Cost: MEDIUM
- Deploy automated individual task tracking system
- Include escalation triggers and status visibility
- Dependencies: IT resources, software procurement

**‚ñ°** **Individual Security Performance Metrics** - Cost: MEDIUM
- Create KPIs tied to individual (not team) performance
- Link to performance reviews and recognition
- Dependencies: HR process changes

### MEDIUM IMPACT / SUPPORTIVE
**‚ñ°** **Shift-Proof Security Procedures** - Cost: LOW-MEDIUM
- Establish procedures that work regardless of staffing
- Include mandatory handoff checklists
- Dependencies: Process documentation time

**‚ñ°** **Security Decision Authority Framework** - Cost: MEDIUM
- Define clear decision rights for different security scenarios
- Include time limits and automatic escalation
- Dependencies: Management approval, policy updates

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 min)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your last security incident - who was the first specific person assigned to respond?"**
- **Good Answer**: Named individual, timeframe <30 minutes, clear process
- **Red Flag**: "The team handled it" OR delays identifying specific person

**"When someone needs an exception to security policy, what's the approval process?"**
- **Good Answer**: Named approver, defined timeframe, recent examples
- **Red Flag**: Committee approval OR "it depends" OR no recent examples

### Follow-up Prompts for Incomplete Answers
**If they say "the security team"**: *"Which specific person on the team?"*
**If they mention committees**: *"Who makes the final decision when the committee disagrees?"*
**If they're vague on timing**: *"Show me the last time this happened - how long did it take?"*
**If they have no examples**: *"Let's look at your incident log from last month."*

### Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation
**‚ñ°** Multiple people claim responsibility for same security function
**‚ñ°** Generic email addresses (security@company.com) for critical communications  
**‚ñ°** "We all work together" responses to individual accountability questions
**‚ñ°** Inability to produce recent examples of individual security actions
**‚ñ°** Shift change periods with no security coverage documentation
**‚ñ°** Post-incident reviews that don't identify specific individual actions

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
**Instead of**: "Your security is chaotic"
**Say**: "Let's clarify individual roles to strengthen your security response"

**Instead of**: "Nobody's accountable"  
**Say**: "We can enhance individual ownership of security processes"

**Instead of**: "This is a major vulnerability"
**Say**: "Individual accountability will reduce your incident response times"

## üìà SUCCESS VALIDATION

### 30-Day Follow-up Checks
**‚ñ°** Security incident response times decreased by 20%
**‚ñ°** Individual task completion rate >95%
**‚ñ°** Zero "unclear responsibility" findings in incident reviews
**‚ñ°** Named individuals can be contacted for 100% of critical security functions

### Client Self-Assessment Questions
1. "Can you reach a specific person for any security issue within 15 minutes?"
2. "Do your security reports show individual names and signatures?"
3. "Are your incident reviews identifying specific individual actions and decisions?"

**Target**: Client answers "YES" to all three questions consistently for 90 days post-implementation.
