## üéØ RAPID SCORING MATRIX (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree Scoring

**START HERE**: Count "Yes" responses from Quick Assessment

**7-6 Yes responses** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**
- Regular debate documented
- External findings implemented quickly
- Dissent valued and documented

**5-4 Yes responses** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**  
- Some debate but quick consensus
- Mixed implementation of external findings
- Inconsistent dissent documentation

**3-0 Yes responses** ‚Üí **RED (2)**
- Rapid consensus without debate
- External findings dismissed regularly
- No dissent documentation systems

### Confirmation Checks
**Upgrade to RED if any present**:
- ‚òê External findings consistently dismissed as "not applicable"
- ‚òê Team members report fear of questioning security decisions
- ‚òê No documented alternatives in major security decisions (last 12 months)
- ‚òê Security questioning leads to negative performance consequences

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**Start with**: "I'd like to understand how your security team makes decisions..."

- **Q**: "Walk me through your most recent major security decision."
- **Follow-up**: "Who disagreed with that approach? How was that handled?"

- **Q**: "Tell me about the last time external findings challenged your assumptions."
- **Follow-up**: "What was the team's reaction? How quickly did you respond?"

### Probing for Red Flags
**If answers seem evasive**:
- **Q**: "Do team members ever come to you privately with different views than they express in meetings?"
- **Q**: "Can you show me documentation where alternatives were considered but rejected?"

### Sensitive Territory Approach
**For performance/cultural issues**:
- **Say**: "In high-performing teams, healthy debate is common. How does that show up here?"
- **Not**: "Do you punish people who disagree?" (too direct)

### Closing Verification
**Before leaving**:
- **Q**: "If I asked your team anonymously about comfort level disagreeing with security decisions, what would they say?"
- **Q**: "What's an example of when an outsider's perspective changed your security approach?"

## üö® AUDITOR ALERTS

### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Escalation
- **CRITICAL**: Team members report retaliation for questioning security decisions
- **CRITICAL**: Multiple external findings ignored without documented rationale  
- **HIGH**: No security approach changes despite significant security incidents
- **HIGH**: Security team completely isolated from business decision-making

### Documentation Standards
- **Always** request specific examples, not general policies
- **Always** verify claims with multiple sources
- **Never** rely solely on leadership perspective
- **Never** accept "we discuss things informally" without documentation evidence

### Professional Boundaries
- **Appropriate**: "How are dissenting views documented in your process?"
- **Inappropriate**: "Why don't people feel safe disagreeing with you?"
- **Focus**: Observable behaviors and documented processes
- **Avoid**: Psychological analysis or personal critique
