# INDICATOR 6.6: Dependency Group Assumptions

## PSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATION

### Core Mechanism

Dependency group assumptions (baD) represent one of Bion's three basic assumptions that groups unconsciously adopt when faced with anxiety. In this state, the group operates under the fundamental belief that survival depends on finding and maintaining connection to an omnipotent leader, figure, or technology that will provide absolute protection and guidance. This psychological mechanism bypasses critical thinking and rational assessment in favor of magical thinking about protective figures.

The dependency assumption manifests as a regression to infantile psychological states where the group collectively abandons adult responsibility and problem-solving capacity, instead seeking an idealized parent figure who will handle all threats and challenges. This creates a profound vulnerability because the group's security posture becomes entirely dependent on the perceived strength and availability of the protective figure, while simultaneously losing the capacity for independent threat assessment and response.

### Research Basis

**Bion's Group Dynamics Theory (1961)**: Wilfred Bion identified dependency (baD) as one of three unconscious basic assumptions groups adopt when work group functioning is threatened by anxiety. His observations in therapeutic groups revealed that when faced with overwhelming anxiety, groups regress to primitive psychological states where they seek omnipotent protection rather than engage in realistic problem-solving.

**Object Relations Theory (Klein, 1946)**: Melanie Klein's work on splitting and idealization provides the psychological foundation for understanding how groups create "all good" protective figures while projecting all danger onto external threats. This splitting prevents realistic assessment of both internal vulnerabilities and external threats.

**Attachment Theory (Bowlby, 1969)**: John Bowlby's attachment research demonstrates how early caregiver relationships create templates for seeking protection under stress. In organizational contexts, these templates are activated during security crises, leading to dependency behaviors that mirror infant-caregiver dynamics.

**Neuroscience Research**: Modern neuroscience research supports Bion's observations, showing that anxiety activates the amygdala and can suppress prefrontal cortex functioning, leading to regression to more primitive psychological states and increased seeking of external protection.

### Cognitive/Emotional Triggers

- **Overwhelming complexity**: When cybersecurity challenges exceed the group's perceived capacity to understand or manage
- **Recent security incidents**: Major breaches or near-misses that activate organizational anxiety
- **Leadership uncertainty**: Periods of leadership transition or unclear authority structures
- **Technological overwhelm**: Introduction of new security technologies that the group cannot comprehend
- **External pressure**: Regulatory requirements, compliance audits, or board pressure that exceed perceived capacity
- **Resource scarcity**: Budget cuts or staffing reductions that threaten security capability
- **Crisis states**: Emergency situations that activate primitive survival responses

## CYBERSECURITY IMPACT

### Primary Attack Vectors

**Vendor Impersonation Attacks**: Attackers exploit dependency relationships by impersonating trusted security vendors, leveraging the organization's psychological need to believe their protective figure has the situation under control.

**False Authority Exploitation**: Social engineers position themselves as the "expert" or "savior" the organization has been unconsciously seeking, exploiting the group's readiness to defer to protective figures.

**Silver Bullet Solution Scams**: Organizations in dependency states become vulnerable to fraudulent security solutions that promise complete protection, bypassing normal due diligence processes.

**Consultant Manipulation**: Malicious actors pose as security consultants offering comprehensive protection, exploiting the organization's psychological need to transfer responsibility to omnipotent figures.

**Supply Chain Dependency Attacks**: Attackers target the trusted vendors and partners that dependency-oriented organizations have idealized, knowing that questioning these relationships is psychologically difficult.

### Historical Incidents

The 2020 SolarWinds attack exemplified how dependency assumptions create vulnerabilities. Organizations had developed such trust in SolarWinds as a protective security tool that they failed to implement adequate monitoring of the software itself, creating a blind spot that attackers exploited.

The Equifax breach demonstrated dependency group assumptions where the organization over-relied on external security tools and vendor assurances while failing to maintain internal security vigilance and responsibility.

Numerous CEO fraud cases exploit dependency assumptions where employees, facing urgent requests from apparent authority figures, bypass normal security protocols because they unconsciously believe the authority figure will handle any consequences.

### Technical Failure Points

**Single Points of Failure**: Dependency assumptions lead to over-reliance on specific security tools, vendors, or key personnel, creating technical vulnerabilities when these fail.

**Inadequate Redundancy**: Groups in dependency states resist implementing backup systems because this implies their protective figure might fail.

**Poor Monitoring of Trusted Systems**: Technical monitoring gaps emerge around idealized security solutions because questioning their effectiveness feels psychologically threatening.

**Vendor Lock-in Vulnerabilities**: Organizations become technically dependent on specific vendors, making migration or diversification difficult even when security concerns arise.

**Configuration Drift**: Over-reliance on automated security tools without human oversight leads to undetected configuration changes that create vulnerabilities.

## ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS

### Structural Amplifiers

**Hierarchical Structures**: Steep organizational hierarchies reinforce dependency assumptions by creating clear parent-child dynamics between leaders and subordinates.

**Centralized Security Models**: Organizations with highly centralized security decision-making amplify dependency assumptions by concentrating protective functions in single figures or departments.

**Vendor Relationship Structures**: Long-term, exclusive vendor relationships can institutionalize dependency assumptions, making it organizationally difficult to question or change protective figures.

**Budget Approval Processes**: Complex approval processes that require senior leadership blessing for security decisions can reinforce dependency assumptions about who has the power to provide protection.

**Crisis Response Structures**: Emergency response procedures that concentrate decision-making in single individuals or small groups can activate and reinforce dependency assumptions during critical moments.

### Cultural Variations

**High Power Distance Cultures**: Organizations from cultures with high power distance (Hofstede) show stronger dependency assumptions, with greater deference to authority figures and less questioning of protective leaders.

**Uncertainty Avoidance Cultures**: Cultures with high uncertainty avoidance may be more susceptible to dependency assumptions as they seek strong protective figures to manage ambiguous threats.

**Collectivist vs. Individualist**: Collectivist cultures may show group-level dependency assumptions while individualist cultures may exhibit individual-level dependency on security technologies or personal protective figures.

**Industry-Specific**: Financial services organizations may show dependency assumptions toward regulatory bodies, while healthcare organizations may exhibit dependency toward compliance frameworks and audit authorities.

### Role-Based Patterns

**Executive Teams**: May exhibit dependency assumptions toward security vendors, consultants, or CISOs, expecting complete protection without understanding underlying mechanisms.

**IT Staff**: Can develop dependency assumptions toward specific security tools or vendors, believing these provide omnipotent protection.

**End Users**: Often exhibit dependency assumptions toward IT departments, believing technical staff will handle all security concerns.

**Security Teams**: May develop dependency assumptions toward threat intelligence feeds, automated tools, or senior security leaders.

**Board Members**: Frequently exhibit dependency assumptions toward executive leadership and external auditors to provide complete security assurance.

## ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### Observable Indicators

**Decision-Making Patterns**:
- Deferring all security decisions to specific individuals or vendors
- Reluctance to question or audit trusted security providers
- Seeking "silver bullet" solutions rather than layered approaches
- Panic when key security personnel are unavailable

**Communication Patterns**:
- Language indicating magical thinking about security solutions
- Resistance to discussions about security limitations or failure modes
- Excessive praise for security tools or personnel
- Anxiety when protective figures are criticized

**Resource Allocation Patterns**:
- Over-investment in single security solutions
- Reluctance to invest in redundant or backup security measures
- Concentration of security budget in single vendor relationships
- Resistance to diversifying security approaches

**Response to Incidents**:
- Immediate seeking of external expert help rather than internal problem-solving
- Blame directed at failure of protective figures rather than systemic issues
- Renewed searching for more powerful protective solutions

### Detection Challenges

**Normalization**: Dependency assumptions often appear as normal vendor relationships or appropriate respect for expertise, making pathological dependency difficult to distinguish from healthy professional relationships.

**Cultural Acceptability**: In many organizational cultures, showing dependency on leaders or vendors is viewed positively as appropriate respect and delegation, masking underlying psychological vulnerabilities.

**Intermittent Manifestation**: Dependency assumptions may only become visible during crisis periods when anxiety activates underlying psychological patterns.

**Resistance to Assessment**: Groups in dependency states often resist examination of their protective relationships because this threatens their psychological security.

**Observer Bias**: Assessors may share dependency assumptions, making it difficult to recognize these patterns objectively.

### Measurement Opportunities

**Vendor Relationship Analysis**:
- Concentration ratios in security vendor spending
- Duration and exclusivity of vendor relationships
- Frequency of vendor performance reviews and audits
- Resistance to vendor diversification initiatives

**Decision-Making Metrics**:
- Percentage of security decisions requiring senior approval
- Time delays in security decisions when key personnel unavailable
- Frequency of seeking external consultation vs. internal problem-solving
- Rate of security tool adoption without proper evaluation

**Communication Pattern Analysis**:
- Language patterns in security communications indicating idealization or magical thinking
- Frequency of questioning security tool effectiveness
- Comfort level with discussing security limitations
- Anxiety responses to security tool or personnel criticism

**Incident Response Patterns**:
- First response actions (internal vs. external help-seeking)
