## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Incident assignment logs** (last 30 days)
- [ ] **SIEM/SOAR alert assignment records** showing automated workflows
- [ ] **Incident response playbooks** with role assignments
- [ ] **After-hours coverage schedule** with named contacts
- [ ] **Security awareness metrics** and reporting trends
- [ ] **Post-incident analysis reports** mentioning coordination issues

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] **"Show me your alert dashboard"** - observe real-time assignment status
- [ ] **"Walk through your last incident"** - timeline from alert to response
- [ ] **"Demonstrate escalation process"** - who decides and how quickly
- [ ] **"Show suspicious email reporting"** - employee process and tools

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Test alert assignment workflow** during live operations
- [ ] **Verify mobile notification setup** for primary responders
- [ ] **Check dashboard accessibility** for team coordination
- [ ] **Review automated escalation timers** and backup assignments

### Interview Targets (5 minutes each)
- [ ] **Security Analyst** - "How do you know which alerts are yours?"
- [ ] **IT Helpdesk Staff** - "When do you escalate vs. handle security issues?"
- [ ] **Department Manager** - "How do employees report suspicious activities?"
- [ ] **After-hours Contact** - "Walk me through weekend incident response"

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE**: Are alerts automatically assigned to named individuals?

‚û§ **IF YES**: Go to Response Time Check
‚û§ **IF NO**: **RED SCORE** - Stop here

**Response Time Check**: Are 80%+ of incidents acknowledged within 30 minutes?

‚û§ **IF YES**: Go to Multi-Team Check  
‚û§ **IF NO**: **YELLOW SCORE** - Continue

**Multi-Team Check**: Do procedures clearly assign ownership for cross-department incidents?

‚û§ **IF YES**: Go to Initiative Check
‚û§ **IF NO**: **YELLOW SCORE** - Continue

**Initiative Check**: Are there 3+ examples in last 60 days of proactive reporting/escalation?

‚û§ **IF YES**: **GREEN SCORE**
‚û§ **IF NO**: **YELLOW SCORE**

### Objective Scoring Criteria

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **üü¢ GREEN (0)** | ‚Ä¢ Named responder assignment exists<br>‚Ä¢ 80%+ alerts acknowledged <30 min<br>‚Ä¢ Clear multi-team ownership procedures<br>‚Ä¢ 3+ proactive initiative examples (60 days) |
| **üü° YELLOW (1)** | ‚Ä¢ Some assignment procedures exist<br>‚Ä¢ Response times vary significantly<br>‚Ä¢ Gaps in cross-team coverage<br>‚Ä¢ Limited proactive reporting evidence |
| **üî¥ RED (2)** | ‚Ä¢ No individual assignment system<br>‚Ä¢ Regular delays >30 minutes<br>‚Ä¢ Multiple "someone else" examples<br>‚Ä¢ Slower response with more people available |

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Walk me through what happened during your last security alert that involved multiple people who could have responded."**

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "How long before someone took ownership?"
- "Did anyone assume someone else was handling it?"
- "What would have happened if [primary person] wasn't available?"

### Red Flag Indicators
- **Phrases like**: "We thought IT was handling it" / "Security usually takes care of that"
- **Time delays**: >30 minutes between alert and human response
- **Confusion about**: Who has authority to escalate incidents
- **Multiple people**: Could have acted but no one did initially

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- Instead of: "Your team has bystander effect problems"
- Say: "Let's optimize incident coordination and individual accountability"

- Instead of: "People are being lazy/irresponsible"  
- Say: "We can improve clarity around response ownership"

- Instead of: "This is a psychological issue"
- Say: "This is about workflow optimization and clear procedures"

### Key Follow-up Questions
1. **"Who specifically gets notified when [specific alert type] fires?"**
2. **"What happens if that person is unavailable or doesn't respond?"**
3. **"How do you track whether someone has started investigating an alert?"**
4. **"When was the last time someone reported something suspicious they noticed?"**
