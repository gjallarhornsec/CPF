## 🎯 RAPID SCORING MATRIX (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree**

**START HERE**: What percentage of security budget goes to top vendor?

- **>50%** → RED
- **30-50%** → Continue to next check
- **<30%** → Continue to next check

**NEXT**: How many people can authorize routine security decisions?

- **1-2 people** → RED
- **3-4 people** → Continue to next check
- **5+ people** → Continue to next check

**NEXT**: When did you last formally review vendor performance?

- **>12 months ago** → RED
- **6-12 months ago** → YELLOW
- **<6 months ago** → Continue to next check

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions**
- "Tell me about your relationship with your primary security vendor. How long have you worked with them?"
- "When you have a security issue, what's typically your first call?"
- "If your security manager was on vacation during an incident, what would happen?"

### **Follow-up Prompts for Incomplete Answers**
- **If they say "We trust our vendor"**: "That's good. How do you verify they're meeting expectations?"
- **If they say "We handle things internally"**: "Can you give me an example of the last time you solved a security problem without external help?"
- **If they seem defensive**: "I'm not questioning your choices, just understanding your processes for our assessment."

### **Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation**
- [ ] Language like "They handle everything" or "We don't need to worry about it"
- [ ] Inability to name specific people who can make security decisions
- [ ] No examples of questioning or auditing vendor performance
- [ ] Panic or anxiety when discussing vendor limitations or backups
- [ ] Mentions of "silver bullet" solutions or "complete protection"

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics**
