## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Instructions**: Check Yes/No based on observable evidence. No interpretation required.

### Core Indicators Checklist

‚ñ° **Q1**: In the last 6 months, have <20% of security meetings included documented dissenting opinions or challenges to group decisions?
   - **Evidence**: Meeting minutes, decision logs, recorded disagreements

‚ñ° **Q2**: Do incident reports focus >80% on external attacker sophistication vs. internal process failures?
   - **Evidence**: Recent incident analysis documents, root cause reports

‚ñ° **Q3**: Are there systems, processes, or individuals exempt from normal security questioning or assessment?
   - **Evidence**: Security audit scope exclusions, "trusted system" designations

‚ñ° **Q4**: When industry security incidents occur, does the organization typically respond with "we're different" within 48 hours?
   - **Evidence**: Communication logs, team responses to industry breaches

‚ñ° **Q5**: Is >70% of security budget/discussion focused on compliance requirements vs. internal risk assessment?
   - **Evidence**: Budget allocations, meeting agendas, project priorities

‚ñ° **Q6**: Have security investment proposals been rejected with consensus but minimal documented analysis in the past year?
   - **Evidence**: Investment decision records, rejection rationales

‚ñ° **Q7**: Do security discussions consistently avoid mentioning specific internal vulnerabilities or weaknesses?
   - **Evidence**: Meeting transcripts, presentation content, discussion topics

**Red Flag Count**: ___/7 (5+ Yes answers = High Risk)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree
**If 5-7 Quick Assessment "Yes" answers:**
‚Üí **RED (Score: 2)** - High collective defense risk

**If 3-4 Quick Assessment "Yes" answers:**
‚Üí **YELLOW (Score: 1)** - Moderate collective defense patterns

**If 0-2 Quick Assessment "Yes" answers:**
‚Üí **GREEN (Score: 0)** - Healthy security discourse

### Objective Criteria Confirmation
- **RED**: <10% meetings with dissent + >90% external attribution + Untouchable systems present
- **YELLOW**: 10-20% meetings with dissent + 70-90% external attribution + Some elevated trust systems  
- **GREEN**: >20% meetings with dissent + Balanced attribution + No exempt systems

### Score: ___/2

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT (Implement First)
‚ñ° **Structured Dissent Process** 
   - Cost: Low | Time: 2-4 weeks | Dependencies: Leadership buy-in
   - Action: Formal devil's advocate assignments in security meetings

‚ñ° **Anonymous Vulnerability Reporting**
   - Cost: Low-Medium | Time: 4-8 weeks | Dependencies: IT system setup
   - Action: Deploy anonymous security concern reporting channel

### MEDIUM IMPACT (Implement Second)
‚ñ° **Balanced Attribution Framework**
   - Cost: Medium | Time: 6-12 weeks | Dependencies: Training development
   - Action: Mandate 50/50 internal/external analysis in incident reports

‚ñ° **External Security Reality Testing**
   - Cost: High | Time: 8-16 weeks | Dependencies: Budget approval, vendor selection
   - Action: Quarterly third-party assumption challenges

### LOW IMPACT (Long-term)
‚ñ° **Cross-Functional Security Review Panels**
   - Cost: Medium | Time: 12-24 weeks | Dependencies: Organizational restructure
   - Action: Include non-security roles in security decision committees

‚ñ° **Internal Risk-Driven Metrics**
   - Cost: Medium | Time: 16-32 weeks | Dependencies: New measurement systems
   - Action: Separate internal risk metrics from compliance requirements

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your last security incident discussion. Who participated and what was the conclusion?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Did anyone disagree with that conclusion?"
- *Red flag*: Unanimous agreement, external-only attribution

**"When you hear about breaches at other companies, what's typically the first response from your team?"**
- *Follow-up*: "How often do you check if you have similar vulnerabilities?"
- *Red flag*: "We're different" or "That wouldn't happen here"

**"Are there any systems or people here that everyone just trusts for security?"**
- *Follow-up*: "When were those last independently assessed?"
- *Red flag*: Defensive responses, long gaps in assessment

### Sensitive Topic Approach
**Instead of**: "Do you have collective blind spots?"
**Ask**: "How does your team ensure all security perspectives are heard?"

**Instead of**: "Are you in denial about threats?"
**Ask**: "How do you balance internal capabilities with external threat sophistication?"

### Escalation Indicators
‚ñ° **Immediate defensive responses** to basic security questions
‚ñ° **Unanimous team responses** with no individual perspectives
‚ñ° **Inability to recall any security disagreements** or challenges
‚ñ° **Automatic blame** of external actors for all security issues
