# 📋 CPF INDICATOR 6.7 FIELD KIT: FIGHT-FLIGHT SECURITY POSTURES

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable condition:**

□ **Security Budget Imbalance**: Is >70% of cybersecurity spending allocated to perimeter security (firewalls, network monitoring) versus internal controls?

□ **Slow Security Decisions**: Do security threat responses typically take more than 2 weeks from identification to decision?

□ **High Exception Rate**: Are security policy exceptions granted at >25% rate or without documented tracking?

□ **Alert Investigation Backlog**: Are <50% of security alerts investigated within 48 hours?

□ **Executive Avoidance**: Do executives regularly defer, abbreviate, or react defensively to security discussions?

□ **Conflict Resolution by Disabling**: When security conflicts with business operations, are security controls disabled rather than alternative solutions found?

□ **Reactive Investment Pattern**: Are major security investments made only after incidents rather than through planned risk assessment?

**SCORING**: 0-1 YES = Green | 2-3 YES = Yellow | 4+ YES = Red

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
□ **Security budget breakdown** (last 12 months by category)
□ **Security policy exception log** (past 6 months)
□ **Alert/incident statistics** (past 3 months)
□ **Executive meeting minutes** mentioning security (past 6 months)
□ **Recent security investment proposals** and approval timelines

### Demonstrations to Request:
□ **"Show me your alert triage process"** - observe 5-minute walkthrough
□ **"Walk through your last major security decision"** - decision timeline and stakeholders
□ **"Demonstrate your security architecture overview"** - control placement rationale

### System Checks to Perform:
□ **SIEM dashboard review** - alert volumes and investigation rates
□ **Security tool inventory** - count and integration status
□ **Policy documentation** - language tone analysis (military vs. business)

### Interview Targets:
□ **CISO/Security Manager**: Decision-making process and executive interactions
□ **IT Operations Lead**: Alert handling and conflict resolution
□ **Business Unit Manager**: Security-business conflict examples
□ **Security Analyst**: Daily alert workload and false positive rates

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**START HERE**: Count total YES responses from Quick Assessment

**IF 0-1 YES**: 
→ Review budget ratio: <30% internal security = YELLOW, otherwise GREEN

**IF 2-3 YES**:
→ Check decision timeline: >2 weeks + >25% exceptions = RED, otherwise YELLOW

**IF 4+ YES**:
→ Automatic RED (multiple dysfunction patterns present)

### Objective Thresholds:
- **Budget Imbalance**: >70% perimeter OR <30% internal = dysfunction
- **Decision Delay**: >10 business days average = dysfunction  
- **Exception Rate**: >25% granted OR no tracking = dysfunction
- **Alert Backlog**: <50% investigated in 48hrs = dysfunction

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Can you walk me through your most recent major security investment decision?"**
- Follow-up: "What triggered this decision - was it planned or reactive?"
- Follow-up: "How long did it take from initial discussion to implementation?"

**"When security alerts come in, what's your typical response process?"**
- Follow-up: "What percentage get investigated within 48 hours?"
- Follow-up: "How do you handle false positives?"

**"How do security discussions typically go in executive meetings?"**
- Follow-up: "Can you give me an example from the past few months?"
- Follow-up: "What's the usual reaction when security issues are raised?"

### Red Flag Follow-ups:
**If they mention "fortress mentality"**: "How do you balance perimeter vs internal security?"

**If they mention "security vs business conflicts"**: "Can you give me a specific recent example and how it was resolved?"

**If they seem defensive**: "This is common - we're just looking to understand your current approach"

### Professional Language:
- Use **"security posture balance"** not "fight-flight response"
- Say **"decision patterns"** not "psychological reactions" 
- Refer to **"organizational dynamics"** not "group psychology"

## ⚠️ AUDITOR NOTES

### Common Pitfalls:
- Don't use psychological terminology with clients
- Focus on observable behaviors, not internal motivations
- Look for patterns across multiple data points
- Avoid triggering defensive responses during interviews

### Success Indicators:
- Client provides specific examples readily
- Evidence supports assessment scoring
- Clear next steps identified
- Client engagement remains constructive throughout

### Emergency Escalation:
If evidence suggests **immediate risk** (>90% perimeter spending + no alert investigation + executive avoidance), recommend **urgent external security consultation** before continuing audit.
