# üìã CPF FIELD KIT 10.3: TIPPING POINT VULNERABILITIES

**Assessment Focus**: Organizations that appear stable but experience sudden, cascading security failures when critical thresholds are exceeded.

**Total Time**: 22 minutes | **Skills Required**: None | **Psychology Background**: Not needed

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable condition:**

‚ñ° **Crisis Clustering**: Organization has experienced 3+ simultaneous high-priority situations in past 6 months  
‚ñ° **Single Authority Dependency**: Security decisions require approval from 1-2 specific individuals only  
‚ñ° **Alert Overload History**: Security team has reported being "overwhelmed" with alerts in past quarter  
‚ñ° **Frequent Override Usage**: Emergency security overrides used more than 2 times per month  
‚ñ° **Recovery Time > 48hrs**: Last major disruption took more than 48 hours to restore normal operations  
‚ñ° **Missing Early Warning**: No systematic monitoring of operational stress indicators  
‚ñ° **Ad-hoc Decision Pattern**: Standard security procedures bypassed during busy periods  

**Quick Score**: 0-2 YES = Green | 3-4 YES = Yellow | 5+ YES = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Incident response reports** from past 12 months
- [ ] **Security policy exception logs** for current year
- [ ] **Organizational chart** showing security decision authority
- [ ] **Help desk ticket volume reports** by month
- [ ] **Emergency contact procedures** for security decisions

### System Demonstrations
- [ ] **Show security alert dashboard** - observe current volume and age of alerts
- [ ] **Walk through approval process** for security policy changes
- [ ] **Demonstrate backup decision-maker access** when primary authority unavailable
- [ ] **Review stress monitoring tools** (if any exist)

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **Security Team Lead** (15 min) - Ask about overwhelming situations
- [ ] **Operations Manager** (10 min) - Ask about competing priorities
- [ ] **Help Desk Supervisor** (10 min) - Ask about peak load periods
- [ ] **Department Head** (10 min) - Ask about emergency decision-making

### System Checks
- [ ] **Count pending security alerts** older than 48 hours
- [ ] **Check for single sign-on dependencies** in security tools
- [ ] **Verify backup authentication methods** exist and function
- [ ] **Test incident escalation procedures** during simulated unavailability

## üéØ RAPID SCORING MATRIX (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree Scoring

**START HERE ‚Üì**

**Q1**: Are security decisions concentrated in 1-2 people only?  
‚Üí **YES** ‚Üí Minimum Yellow Score  
‚Üí **NO** ‚Üí Continue

**Q2**: Emergency overrides used 3+ times in past 3 months?  
‚Üí **YES** ‚Üí Yellow Score (Red if also YES to Q1)  
‚Üí **NO** ‚Üí Continue

**Q3**: Last crisis took 72+ hours to restore normal security operations?  
‚Üí **YES** ‚Üí Red Score  
‚Üí **NO** ‚Üí Continue

**Q4**: 20+ security alerts currently older than 48 hours?  
‚Üí **YES** ‚Üí Yellow Score  
‚Üí **NO** ‚Üí Green Score

### Final Score Criteria
- **Green (0)**: Distributed authority, consistent procedures, <24hr recovery
- **Yellow (1)**: Some concentration, occasional bypasses, 24-72hr recovery  
- **Red (2)**: Single points of failure, frequent abandonment, 72+hr recovery

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Cross-train backup decision-makers** (Cost: Low, Time: 2 weeks)
- **Set automated alert thresholds** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)
- **Create emergency decision matrix** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM  
- **Deploy stress monitoring dashboard** (Cost: Medium, Time: 2 months)
- **Implement graceful degradation protocols** (Cost: Medium, Time: 3 months)
- **Build resilience buffer capacity** (Cost: High, Time: 6 months)

### MEDIUM IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Document fallback procedures** (Cost: Low, Time: 2 weeks)
- **Create crisis communication channels** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)
- **Establish override tracking system** (Cost: Low, Time: 2 weeks)

### Dependencies to Flag
- **Executive buy-in required** for authority distribution changes
- **Budget approval needed** for monitoring tools and buffer capacity
- **Training time required** for all staff on new procedures

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about the last time multiple urgent situations happened simultaneously. How did your team handle security decisions during that period?"**

### Follow-up Prompts for Incomplete Answers
- "Who specifically had to approve security changes during that time?"
- "What normal procedures had to be skipped or modified?"
- "How long did it take to get back to normal operations?"
- "What would have happened if [key person] wasn't available?"

### Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation
- **Mentions of "heroic efforts"** to restore operations
- **References to "once-in-a-lifetime"** crises happening repeatedly
- **Describes security as "getting in the way"** during busy times
- **Cannot name backup decision-makers** for security approvals
- **Says "we'll cross that bridge when we come to it"** about stress scenarios

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- Instead of "failure": "areas for improvement"
- Instead of "broken": "opportunities to strengthen"
- Instead of "chaos": "challenging coordination"
- Instead of "ignored": "deprioritized during peak periods"
