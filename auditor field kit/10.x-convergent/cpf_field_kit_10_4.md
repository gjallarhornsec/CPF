## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Instructions:** Ask client to answer Yes/No for each question. Check one box per question.

| # | Question | Yes ‚òê | No ‚òê |
|---|----------|-------|------|
| 1 | Do your security teams (network, endpoint, application, physical) meet monthly or more to discuss vulnerabilities? | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 2 | When analyzing security incidents, do you systematically examine how attackers bypassed multiple security layers? | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 3 | Do you have a coordinated process for managing vulnerabilities across all security technologies simultaneously? | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 4 | Do your risk assessments specifically evaluate how vulnerabilities might align across multiple security layers? | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 5 | Can your monitoring systems alert when multiple security layers are compromised simultaneously? | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 6 | Do you conduct regular reviews to identify gaps between different security defensive layers? | ‚òê | ‚òê |
| 7 | Do your security vendors coordinate their threat intelligence and incident response activities? | ‚òê | ‚òê |

**Quick Score:** Count "Yes" responses: ___/7

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Meeting minutes** from last 6 months of security team coordination meetings
- [ ] **Most recent incident analysis report** showing multi-layer examination
- [ ] **Vulnerability management procedure** documentation
- [ ] **Current risk assessment** that addresses cross-layer vulnerabilities
- [ ] **SIEM/monitoring system configuration** showing cross-layer correlation rules
- [ ] **Security architecture review report** from last 12 months
- [ ] **Security vendor coordination agreements** or communication records

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] **"Show me your security monitoring dashboard"** - Look for integrated multi-layer views
- [ ] **"Walk me through your last incident analysis"** - Listen for multi-layer investigation
- [ ] **"Demonstrate vulnerability tracking across teams"** - Observe coordination mechanisms
- [ ] **"Show me how you assess cross-layer risks"** - Verify systemic evaluation methods

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **SIEM console:** Verify correlation rules exist for cross-layer events
- [ ] **Vulnerability scanner:** Check if it tracks dependencies across security layers
- [ ] **Risk register:** Look for entries addressing systemic vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Communication tools:** Verify channels exist for cross-team security coordination

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **CISO or Security Manager:** Strategic coordination approach
- [ ] **SOC Analyst:** Day-to-day cross-layer monitoring practices
- [ ] **Network Security Lead:** Coordination with other security teams
- [ ] **Risk Manager:** Cross-layer vulnerability assessment methods

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Decision Tree:** Follow this path based on evidence collected.

```
START: Count "Yes" responses from Quick Assessment

‚îú‚îÄ 6-7 Yes responses
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ GREEN (0): Coordinated Defense
‚îÇ     ‚úì Evidence of monthly cross-team meetings
‚îÇ     ‚úì Systematic multi-layer incident analysis
‚îÇ     ‚úì Integrated monitoring with correlation rules

‚îú‚îÄ 3-5 Yes responses  
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ YELLOW (1): Partial Integration
‚îÇ     ‚úì Some cross-team coordination (quarterly meetings)
‚îÇ     ‚úì Limited multi-layer analysis
‚îÇ     ‚úì Basic monitoring correlation

‚îî‚îÄ 0-2 Yes responses
   ‚îî‚îÄ RED (2): Siloed Operations
      ‚úó No systematic cross-team coordination
      ‚úó Single-layer incident analysis only
      ‚úó Independent monitoring per layer
```

**Final Score:** ‚òê Green (0) ‚òê Yellow (1) ‚òê Red (2)

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your most recent security incident. How did you analyze what went wrong?"**
- *Listen for:* Multi-layer analysis vs. single point of failure focus
- *Red flag:* Only mentions one security control failure

**"When was the last time your network, endpoint, and application security teams met together?"**
- *Listen for:* Specific dates and regular cadence
- *Red flag:* "They don't really need to meet" or dates >6 months ago

### Follow-Up Prompts
**If they mention vulnerability management:**
- "How do you coordinate patching across different security technologies?"

**If they mention monitoring:**
- "Can you show me an alert that indicated problems across multiple security layers?"

**If they mention risk assessments:**
- "Do your risk assessments consider how vulnerabilities might combine across different security controls?"

### Red Flag Indicators
- [ ] **"Each team handles their own security"** - Indicates dangerous silos
- [ ] **"We haven't had any major incidents"** - May indicate blind spots
- [ ] **"Our tools are all best-of-breed"** - May lack integration
- [ ] **"We focus on the perimeter"** - Single-layer thinking
- [ ] **"That's not our responsibility"** - Accountability gaps

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
**Instead of:** "You have Swiss cheese security"
**Say:** "We're evaluating coordination between your security layers"

**Instead of:** "Your teams don't communicate"  
**Say:** "We're assessing cross-functional security collaboration"

**Instead of:** "This is a critical vulnerability"
**Say:** "This presents opportunities for security enhancement"
