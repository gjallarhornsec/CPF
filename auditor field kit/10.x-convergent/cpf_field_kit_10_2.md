# üìã CPF FIELD KIT 10.2: CASCADE FAILURE TRIGGERS

**Assessment Target**: Organizational vulnerability to security incident escalation during stress
**Total Time**: 22 minutes | **Scoring**: Green (0), Yellow (1), Red (2)

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Instructions**: Check YES/NO for each item. Look for documented evidence only.

### 1. Incident Response Structure
‚ñ° **YES** - Written incident response plan with defined roles exists  
‚ñ° **NO** - No documented plan or roles are unclear

### 2. Crisis Communication Backup
‚ñ° **YES** - Backup communication systems documented (alt platforms, phone trees)  
‚ñ° **NO** - Only primary communication channels available

### 3. Security Exception Tracking
‚ñ° **YES** - Digital system tracks all security policy exceptions with approvals  
‚ñ° **NO** - Exceptions handled informally or not tracked

### 4. Leadership Crisis Training
‚ñ° **YES** - Senior leaders have documented crisis communication training  
‚ñ° **NO** - No evidence of leadership crisis training

### 5. Cross-Department Dependencies
‚ñ° **YES** - Documented business impact analysis showing IT/security dependencies  
‚ñ° **NO** - Dependencies not mapped or documented

### 6. Backup Decision Authority
‚ñ° **YES** - Clear succession plan for security decisions during crisis  
‚ñ° **NO** - Unclear who makes security decisions when leaders unavailable

### 7. Alert Prioritization Process
‚ñ° **YES** - Written procedures for handling multiple simultaneous alerts  
‚ñ° **NO** - No structured approach to alert prioritization

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Incident Response Plan** - Look for org chart with crisis roles
- [ ] **Recent Incident Reports** - Check coordination time and departments involved
- [ ] **Security Exception Log** - Review frequency during busy periods
- [ ] **Business Continuity Plan** - Verify dependency mapping exists
- [ ] **Crisis Communication Templates** - Check for pre-drafted messages
- [ ] **Training Records** - Leadership crisis communication training
- [ ] **Alert Response Procedures** - Documented triage processes

### System Demonstrations
- [ ] **"Show me your backup communication system"** - Test functionality
- [ ] **"Walk through your exception approval process"** - Check digital workflow
- [ ] **"Demonstrate alert prioritization"** - See actual tools/procedures
- [ ] **"Show recent incident coordination"** - Review actual response logs

### Key Interview Targets
- [ ] **IT/Security Manager** - Ask about overwhelming situations
- [ ] **Incident Response Lead** - Discuss coordination challenges  
- [ ] **Department Head** - Impact when IT is unavailable
- [ ] **Executive Assistant** - Leadership availability during stress

### System Checks
- [ ] **Exception tracking system** - Log in and verify functionality
- [ ] **Communication platform backups** - Test alternative systems
- [ ] **Alert management console** - Check prioritization features
- [ ] **Incident response tools** - Verify role assignments work

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here**: Count total "YES" answers from Quick Assessment

**If 6-7 YES answers** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**
- Robust cascade failure prevention
- All critical controls documented and functional

**If 4-5 YES answers** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**  
- Moderate cascade risk
- Some controls present but gaps exist

**If 0-3 YES answers** ‚Üí **RED (2)**
- High cascade vulnerability  
- Critical controls missing or inadequate

### Scoring Override Conditions
**Force RED (2) if ANY of these exist:**
- No incident response plan at all
- Security exceptions have NO tracking/approval
- NO backup decision authority identified
- Recent incident caused multi-department chaos (from interviews)

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- [ ] **Create crisis communication backup** (Alt Slack workspace, phone tree)
- [ ] **Deploy exception tracking system** (Simple ticketing workflow)
- [ ] **Document backup decision authority** (Update org charts, notify staff)

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM TIMELINE  
- [ ] **Incident command system training** (Cross-train multiple role-fillers)
- [ ] **Executive crisis communication coaching** (Professional development)
- [ ] **Tabletop exercise program** (Quarterly cascade failure scenarios)

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG TIMELINE
- [ ] **Business dependency mapping** (Full business impact analysis)
- [ ] **Automated circuit breakers** (Systems to isolate failures)
- [ ] **Stress monitoring dashboard** (Anonymous organizational health metrics)

### Cost Estimates
**Low ($1K-$10K)**: Communication backups, documentation updates, basic training  
**Medium ($10K-$50K)**: Exception tracking systems, structured exercises, coaching  
**High ($50K+)**: Automated circuit breakers, comprehensive dependency analysis

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your last significant IT incident..."**
- Who was involved? How were decisions made?
- How long did coordination take?
- What departments were affected?

### Follow-up Prompts
**If they mention coordination problems:**
- "What specific communication breakdowns occurred?"
- "How did this impact your response time?"

**If they mention security exceptions:**
- "How often do people request policy exceptions during busy periods?"
- "Who approves these? How do you track them?"

**If they describe leadership during crisis:**
- "How do senior leaders communicate during organizational challenges?"
- "Are staff confident in leadership during stressful periods?"

### Red Flag Indicators
- [ ] **"We just figure it out as we go"** - No incident structure
- [ ] **"People just email whoever they know"** - No formal communication
- [ ] **"We bend the rules when things get busy"** - Untracked exceptions
- [ ] **"Leadership goes quiet during tough times"** - Crisis communication failure
- [ ] **"Everything stops when IT has problems"** - Undocumented dependencies

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
**Instead of**: "Your organization has cascade failure vulnerabilities"  
**Say**: "We identified opportunities to strengthen coordination during high-stress periods"

**Instead of**: "Your leaders create panic"  
**Say**: "Enhanced crisis communication training could improve organizational confidence"
