## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Instructions**: Check YES/NO for each item. 4+ NO answers = RED score likely.

‚òê **Critical Patch Timeline**: Are critical vulnerabilities consistently patched within 30 days?
   - YES: Documented process with <30 day average
   - NO: >30 days average or no tracking system

‚òê **Security Exception Control**: Are security policy exceptions <5% of total policies?
   - YES: <5% active exceptions with sunset dates
   - NO: >5% exceptions or permanent workarounds common

‚òê **Legacy System Planning**: Do all legacy systems have funded remediation plans?
   - YES: Documented plans with allocated budgets
   - NO: Systems identified but no concrete timeline/funding

‚òê **Incident Response Testing**: Is incident response tested quarterly with improvements implemented?
   - YES: Quarterly tests with documented lessons learned
   - NO: Annual or less frequent testing

‚òê **Security Training Compliance**: Is security training completion >95% organization-wide?
   - YES: >95% completion with automated tracking
   - NO: <95% completion or manual/inconsistent tracking

‚òê **Vendor Security Assessment**: Are vendor security reviews conducted annually with follow-up?
   - YES: Annual assessments with documented remediation tracking
   - NO: Inconsistent vendor reviews or no follow-up process

‚òê **Known Risk Investment**: Does security budget prioritize addressing known vulnerabilities?
   - YES: Clear allocation toward identified risks with business cases
   - NO: Budget focused on new tools/threats over known issues

- [ ] **Show me**: Security exception approval workflow
- [ ] **Show me**: Automated patch deployment process
- [ ] **Show me**: Incident response communication procedures
- [ ] **Show me**: Security training assignment and tracking system

### **System Checks to Perform**
- [ ] Count active security exceptions in management system
- [ ] Review age of oldest unpatched critical vulnerability
- [ ] Check incident response plan last update date
- [ ] Verify security training completion percentages
- [ ] Examine vendor risk scoring and monitoring tools

### **Key Interviews**
- [ ] **CISO/Security Leader**: Strategy and resource allocation decisions
- [ ] **IT Operations Manager**: Patch management and exception processes
- [ ] **Compliance Officer**: Training tracking and vendor assessments
- [ ] **Incident Response Lead**: Testing frequency and improvement implementation

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree**

**START**: Count YES answers from Quick Assessment section

**7 YES answers** ‚Üí **GREEN (0 - Low Vulnerability)**
- Strong controls with systematic threat management
- Proactive remediation culture established

**5-6 YES answers** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1 - Moderate Vulnerability)**
- Some gaps in systematic approach
- Risk of selective threat management

**0-4 YES answers** ‚Üí **RED (2 - High Vulnerability)**
- Systematic avoidance of known threats
- High probability of exploitation

### **Tie-Breaker Criteria**
If borderline between scores:
- **Critical vulnerability age >90 days** = automatic RED
- **>15% permanent security exceptions** = automatic RED
- **No incident response testing in 12+ months** = automatic RED
- **<80% security training compliance** = automatic RED

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions**
"I'd like to understand how your organization handles predictable security threats that you can see coming..."

### **Key Interview Prompts**

**On Vulnerability Management**:
- "Walk me through what happens when you get a critical vulnerability report."
- *Follow-up*: "What's your average time from discovery to patch deployment?"
- *Red flag*: Answers >90 days or "it depends on business impact"

**On Security Exceptions**:
- "How often do departments request exceptions to security policies?"
- *Follow-up*: "What percentage of 'temporary' exceptions become permanent?"
- *Red flag*: >15% exceptions or "most become permanent for operational reasons"

**On Legacy Systems**:
- "What's your oldest system that you know has security concerns?"
- *Follow-up*: "What's your timeline for addressing it?"
- *Red flag*: No specific timeline or "we're exploring options"

**On Incident Preparedness**:
- "When did you last test your incident response plan?"
- *Follow-up*: "What improvements did you implement afterward?"
- *Red flag*: >12 months ago or no improvements implemented

### **Sensitive Topic Language**
- Use: "organizations often struggle with..." instead of "you're failing to..."
- Use: "predictable challenges" instead of "obvious problems"
- Use: "optimization opportunities" instead of "critical gaps"
