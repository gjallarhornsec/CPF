## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- [ ] **Crisis Communication Templates** (Cost: Low | Time: 1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Authority Matrix Documentation** (Cost: Low | Time: 1 week)  
- [ ] **Emergency Contact Verification** (Cost: Low | Time: immediate)

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
- [ ] **Crisis Coordination Center Setup** (Cost: Medium | Time: 1-3 months)
- [ ] **Automated Security Guardrails** (Cost: High | Time: 3-6 months)
- [ ] **Perfect Storm Simulation Program** (Cost: Medium | Time: 2-4 months)

### MEDIUM IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION  
- [ ] **Decision Triage Framework** (Cost: Low | Time: 2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **Recovery Verification Checklists** (Cost: Low | Time: 1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Backup Communication Systems** (Cost: Medium | Time: 1 month)

**Dependencies:**
- Crisis Coordination Center requires Authority Matrix first
- Automated Guardrails require Decision Triage Framework first
- Simulation Program requires basic procedures in place first

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about the last time you had 3+ critical issues happening simultaneously. How did coordination work?"**

*Follow-up if vague response:*
- "Who was in charge of overall coordination?"
- "How did communication flow between teams?"
- "What security decisions got delayed or bypassed?"

### Authority Structure Probing
**"If a critical security decision needed to be made this weekend, who would make it and how quickly could you reach them?"**

*Red flags to watch for:*
- Uncertainty about who has authority
- Single points of failure (one person only)
- Vague timing estimates ("eventually," "we'd figure it out")

### Stress Response Assessment
**"When you get conflicting urgent requests from multiple executives, what's your process for handling security decisions?"**

*Follow-up prompts:*
- "Can you give me a recent example?"
- "How do you prevent security shortcuts under pressure?"
- "What happens to normal approval processes?"

### Recovery Verification
**"After a crisis period ends, how do you ensure any bypassed security measures get restored?"**

*Red flags:*
- No systematic process described
- Reliance on memory rather than checklists
- Assumption that "everything returns to normal automatically"

## üö® AUDITOR ALERTS

### Immediate Escalation Required If:
- No written crisis procedures exist at all
- Authority structure completely unclear to interviewees  
- Recent crisis caused security breach or incident
- Client shows resistance to discussing crisis management

### Common Client Deflections:
- *"We've never had multiple crises"* ‚Üí Ask about recent mergers, leadership changes, system outages
- *"Everyone knows what to do"* ‚Üí Request demonstration of coordination process
- *"It's all handled informally"* ‚Üí Probe for documentation and backup plans
- *"Our tools handle everything automatically"* ‚Üí Verify human oversight and manual override capabilities

### Documentation Standards:
- All responses must be specific and include examples
- Vague or hypothetical answers indicate higher vulnerability
- Look for consistency between different interviewees
- Focus on recent events (past 12 months) for accuracy

**Total Assessment Time Target: 22 minutes**
