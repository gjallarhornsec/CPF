# INDICATOR 10.9: System Coupling Failures

## CONTEXT

System coupling failures occur when organizations fail to recognize and manage the hidden connections between their IT systems, creating cascading security vulnerabilities. When one system is compromised, attackers exploit these unrecognized connections to move laterally through the network, amplify damage, and access high-value targets through seemingly unrelated entry points. This vulnerability stems from the human tendency to treat interconnected systems as separate, independent components.

## ASSESSMENT

### Question 1: System Integration Documentation
**When you implement a new system or make significant changes to existing ones, what process do you follow to document how it connects to other systems?**
*Tell us about a specific recent system implementation and what documentation was created about its connections to other systems.*

### Question 2: Change Impact Analysis
**How often do system changes cause unexpected problems in other, seemingly unrelated systems?**
*Give us a recent example where a change in one system affected another system that wasn't expected to be impacted.*

### Question 3: Cross-System Incident Response
**When you experience a security incident, what's your standard procedure for checking if other systems might be affected?**
*Describe your most recent security incident and which systems you checked for potential impact.*

### Question 4: Vendor and Third-Party System Connections
**What process do you use to understand and manage how third-party systems connect to your internal systems?**
*Tell us about a recent vendor implementation and how you assessed its connections to your existing systems.*

### Question 5: System Dependency Mapping
**How frequently do you review and update documentation about which systems depend on each other?**
*Show us your most recent system dependency documentation and when it was last updated.*

### Question 6: Emergency Change Procedures
**When you need to make emergency changes to critical systems, what steps ensure you don't break connections to other systems?**
*Give us an example of your last emergency change and what checks were performed.*

### Question 7: Cross-Team Communication
**How do different IT teams (network, security, applications, etc.) coordinate when making changes that might affect other teams' systems?**
*Describe a recent example where multiple teams had to coordinate on a system change.*

## SCORING

**Green (0): Low Vulnerability**
- Formal process exists for documenting system connections before implementation
- Regular (quarterly or more frequent) review of system dependencies
- Standard incident response includes checking connected systems
- Emergency changes have mandatory connection impact checks
- Cross-team coordination is required and documented

**Yellow (1): Moderate Vulnerability**
- Some documentation of system connections exists but is incomplete or outdated
- Occasional unexpected impacts from system changes (1-2 per quarter)
- Incident response sometimes includes connection checks
- Emergency changes have informal connection considerations
- Cross-team coordination happens but isn't consistently documented

**Red (2): High Vulnerability**
- Little to no documentation of system connections
- Frequent unexpected impacts from system changes (monthly or more)
- Incident response focuses only on directly affected systems
- Emergency changes proceed without connection impact analysis
- Teams work in isolation with minimal coordination

## RISK SCENARIOS

### Advanced Persistent Threat Lateral Movement
Attackers compromise a low-security system (like HVAC or printer management) and use undocumented connections to access critical business systems. The organization doesn't detect the lateral movement because they don't understand how their systems are connected. **Business Impact**: Data theft, ransomware deployment across entire network, extended dwell time allowing maximum damage.

### Supply Chain Attack Amplification
A software update from a trusted vendor contains malicious code that spreads through connected systems beyond the originally targeted application. The organization can't contain the incident because they don't know which systems share connections with the compromised vendor software. **Business Impact**: Complete network compromise, regulatory violations, loss of customer trust.

### Cascading System Failures
A routine maintenance change to one system causes unexpected failures in connected systems, creating a security window that attackers exploit. The organization can't quickly restore security because they don't understand the system dependencies. **Business Impact**: Extended downtime, data exposure during recovery, inability to maintain security controls.

### Cloud-to-Premises Bridge Attacks
Attackers compromise a cloud service that has hidden connections to on-premises systems through single sign-on, shared databases, or backup systems. The organization treats cloud and on-premises as separate security domains and misses the breach. **Business Impact**: Complete infrastructure compromise, data exfiltration from both environments, compliance violations.

## SOLUTION CATALOG

### Network Dependency Mapping Tool
**Implementation**: Deploy automated network discovery tools (like Lansweeper, Device42, or open-source options like Nmap/SNMP discovery) that continuously map system connections and dependencies.
**Process**: Weekly automated scans with monthly review meetings to validate discovered connections and update documentation.
**Outcome**: Real-time visibility into system connections with automated alerts for new or changed relationships.

### Cross-System Change Approval Process
**Implementation**: Establish mandatory change review process requiring impact analysis for any system modifications, including a checklist of potentially connected systems.
**Process**: Create change request template that requires listing all potentially affected systems, with approval required from owners of connected systems.
**Outcome**: Structured prevention of unexpected system impacts through systematic connection consideration.

### Incident Response Connection Protocol
**Implementation**: Develop incident response playbook that includes mandatory steps for checking connected systems, with specific checklists for common system types.
**Process**: Train incident response team on connection analysis techniques and provide tools for rapid system relationship queries.
**Outcome**: Faster incident containment and reduced lateral movement through systematic connection checking.

### Quarterly System Relationship Reviews
**Implementation**: Schedule regular cross-team meetings to review and update system dependency documentation, with representatives from all IT teams.
**Process**: Create standardized agenda focusing on new connections, changed relationships, and validation of existing documentation.
**Outcome**: Maintained accuracy of system connection awareness through regular collaborative review.

### Vendor Integration Security Assessment
**Implementation**: Develop vendor onboarding checklist that requires detailed analysis of how third-party systems will connect to internal infrastructure.
**Process**: Create security review template for vendor implementations that maps all connection points and potential risks.
**Outcome**: Proactive identification and management of third-party system connection risks.

### Emergency Change Connection Checklist
**Implementation**: Create mandatory rapid assessment tool for emergency changes that lists common system connections and requires verification before proceeding.
**Process**: Develop 15-minute emergency connection check procedure that can be performed even under time pressure.
**Outcome**: Prevention of emergency change cascading failures through systematic connection consideration.
