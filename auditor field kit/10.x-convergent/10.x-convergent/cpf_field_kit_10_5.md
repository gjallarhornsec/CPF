# üìã INDICATOR 10.5 FIELD KIT: BLACK SWAN BLINDNESS

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each item:**

‚ñ° **Novel Exercise Program**: Organization conducts security exercises with completely new attack scenarios (not variations of known threats) at least quarterly

‚ñ° **Unknown Incident Protocol**: Written procedures exist specifically for investigating security incidents that don't match existing categories or playbooks  

‚ñ° **Black Swan Budget**: Security budget allocation includes specific percentage (10%+) dedicated to preparing for unprecedented threats

‚ñ° **Multiple Intelligence Sources**: Organization subscribes to threat intelligence beyond standard feeds (academic research, theoretical attack studies, proof-of-concept publications)

‚ñ° **Detection Testing**: Security team tests detection capabilities against novel attack patterns (not signature-based) at least monthly

‚ñ° **Cross-Functional Risk Workshops**: Regular meetings (monthly/quarterly) where teams brainstorm unprecedented attack scenarios involving non-IT systems

‚ñ° **Extreme Scenario Documentation**: Risk register includes high-impact scenarios the organization has never experienced but are theoretically possible

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] Security exercise reports from last 6 months
- [ ] Incident response procedures (look for "unknown threat" sections)  
- [ ] Current security budget breakdown by threat category
- [ ] Risk register/assessment documentation
- [ ] Threat intelligence source list and subscriptions
- [ ] Detection system testing reports

### Demonstration Requests:
- [ ] **"Show me your most unusual security exercise from this year"**
- [ ] **"Walk me through what happens when you encounter an attack you've never seen"**
- [ ] **"Demonstrate how you test for threats not in your current signatures"**

### System Checks:
- [ ] Review detection system logs for novel pattern testing
- [ ] Check threat intelligence feeds and sources
- [ ] Examine incident categories in ticketing system

### Interview Targets:
- [ ] **Security Operations Manager** (daily threat handling)
- [ ] **Risk Manager** (extreme scenario planning)  
- [ ] **Incident Response Lead** (unknown threat procedures)
- [ ] **Red Team Lead** (novel attack testing)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Follow this decision tree:**

### GREEN (0 points)
**ALL of these must be present:**
- Monthly novel scenario exercises documented
- 20%+ budget allocated to unprecedented threats  
- Written procedures for unknown incidents exist
- Multiple non-standard intelligence sources active
- Monthly detection testing against novel patterns

### YELLOW (1 point)  
**If missing 1-2 GREEN requirements:**
- Quarterly novel exercises OR 10-20% budget allocation
- Informal unknown incident procedures OR occasional novel testing
- Some alternative intelligence sources OR periodic extreme scenario research

### RED (2 points)
**If missing 3+ GREEN requirements:**
- Only known scenario drills documented
- Less than 10% budget for new threats
- No unknown incident procedures
- Only standard threat intelligence feeds
- No novel attack pattern testing

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
**Cost: Low-Medium**
- ‚úÖ **Unknown-Unknown Response Protocol** (2-4 weeks)
- ‚úÖ **Extreme Scenario Planning Workshops** (immediate start)
- ‚úÖ **Threat Intelligence Expansion** (1-2 weeks)

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM  
**Cost: Medium-High**
- üî∂ **Red Team Innovation Program** (3-6 months)
- üî∂ **Dynamic Detection Testing** (2-4 months)
- üî∂ **Black Swan Budget Reallocation** (next budget cycle)

### DEPENDENCIES
**Required before other solutions:**
- Leadership buy-in for unprecedented threat preparation
- Cross-functional team formation
- Budget allocation approval

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Tell me about the most unusual security scenario you've practiced in the last year."**
- *Follow-up: "Was this based on a real attack you'd seen before, or something completely new?"*

**"What happens when your security team encounters something that doesn't match any playbook?"**
- *Follow-up: "Can you give me a specific example from recent months?"*

**"How do you prepare for cyber threats that haven't happened to anyone yet?"**
- *Follow-up: "What percentage of your security budget goes toward these unprecedented scenarios?"*

### Red Flag Indicators:
‚ö†Ô∏è **"We focus on realistic threats"** (dismisses extreme scenarios)
‚ö†Ô∏è **"Our threat intelligence covers everything we need"** (single source dependency)
‚ö†Ô∏è **"We've never had an incident we couldn't handle"** (overconfidence indicator)
‚ö†Ô∏è **"Unprecedented scenarios aren't cost-effective"** (budget-driven blindness)

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:
- **Instead of:** "You're blind to black swan events"  
- **Say:** "There may be opportunities to strengthen preparation for novel threat scenarios"

- **Instead of:** "Your risk model is flawed"
- **Say:** "Your risk framework could benefit from expanded scenario coverage"
