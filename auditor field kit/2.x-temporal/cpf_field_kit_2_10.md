# üìã INDICATOR 2.10 FIELD KIT: TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY PRESSURE

**Assessment Target**: Organizations that bypass security procedures to maintain consistent response times and schedules

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization has bypassed security approval processes in past 6 months due to deadlines
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security procedures are modified or skipped when they would delay customer commitments  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Response times to security reviews decrease during busy periods (quarter-end, holidays)
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Executive or VIP requests receive expedited processing that skips normal security steps
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Meeting schedules and project timelines take priority over security requirements
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Staff express concern about appearing "slow" or "inefficient" due to security compliance
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Emergency access procedures are used to maintain service consistency rather than true emergencies

**Quick Score**: 0-2 YES = Green | 3-4 YES = Yellow | 5+ YES = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Security exception logs** from past 12 months
- [ ] **Project schedules** showing security review timeframes
- [ ] **Emergency access logs** and approval records  
- [ ] **Performance evaluation criteria** mentioning response times
- [ ] **Customer service level agreements** with response time commitments

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] **"Show me your emergency access process"** - Who approves? How quickly?
- [ ] **"Walk through last urgent executive request"** - What steps were followed/skipped?
- [ ] **"Demonstrate security approval workflow"** - Where are bottlenecks?
- [ ] **"Show me project timeline templates"** - Is security review time built in?

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Review break-glass access controls** - Automatic expiration? Dual authorization?
- [ ] **Check security workflow integration** - Built into project management tools?
- [ ] **Examine override audit trails** - Who, when, why documented?
- [ ] **Test notification systems** - Alerts for emergency access usage?

### Interview Targets (5 minutes each)
- [ ] **Project Manager**: "How do security requirements affect your deadlines?"
- [ ] **IT Operations**: "What happens during after-hours emergencies?"
- [ ] **Customer Service Lead**: "How do you handle urgent customer requests?"
- [ ] **Finance Manager**: "Describe your month-end/quarter-end security process"

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here**: Count total security bypasses in past 12 months

‚Üí **0-2 bypasses** AND documented approval process = **GREEN**
‚Üí **3-6 bypasses** AND some approval documentation = **YELLOW**  
‚Üí **7+ bypasses** OR no approval documentation = **RED**

### Override Criteria
**Automatic RED if ANY of these present:**
- [ ] No documentation for security bypasses
- [ ] Emergency access without time limits
- [ ] Staff instructed to "be flexible" with security for deadlines
- [ ] Security team excluded from urgent request processes

### Confirmation Checks
**GREEN**: Security timelines built into all project schedules
**YELLOW**: Mixed approach - some projects include security time
**RED**: Security viewed as impediment to operational efficiency

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Help me understand your typical response to urgent requests..."**
- "Walk me through what happened the last time an executive needed something immediately"
- "How do your teams handle conflicting priorities between speed and security?"
- "What's your busiest time of year, and how does that affect security processes?"

### Follow-Up Prompts
**If they mention bypassing security:**
- "Who typically makes the decision to skip those steps?"
- "How do you document when security procedures are bypassed?"
- "What's the review process after an emergency override?"

**If they mention time pressure:**
- "How do customer expectations influence your security decisions?"
- "What happens if security verification would delay a promised deadline?"
- "Tell me about your emergency access procedures"

### Red Flag Indicators (Probe Deeper)
- [ ] **"We're very responsive to our customers"** ‚Üí How does this affect security?
- [ ] **"Security can't slow us down"** ‚Üí What's the escalation process?
- [ ] **"We handle things case-by-case"** ‚Üí Who makes these decisions?
- [ ] **"Everyone knows what to do in emergencies"** ‚Üí Is this documented?

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
**Instead of**: "You bypass security procedures"
**Say**: "You have flexible processes for urgent situations"

**Instead of**: "This is a vulnerability"  
**Say**: "This creates some risk exposure we can address"
