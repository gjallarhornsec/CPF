# üìã CPF INDICATOR 2.2 FIELD KIT
## TIME PRESSURE COGNITIVE DEGRADATION

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each item:**

‚ñ° **Crisis Bypass Evidence**: Organization has documented instances of security procedures being bypassed during emergencies or crises

‚ñ° **Deadline Exception Pattern**: Security exceptions are regularly requested and approved due to project deadlines (>3 per quarter)

‚ñ° **Emergency Change Shortcuts**: Emergency IT changes routinely skip security reviews or approvals that normal changes require

‚ñ° **Peak Period Degradation**: Security practices visibly deteriorate during busy periods (quarter-end, holidays, launches)

‚ñ° **Pressure Authentication Issues**: Password sharing, MFA bypassing, or access control violations occur during high-pressure periods

‚ñ° **Rushed Incident Response**: Security incident response quality degrades when organization is under operational pressure

‚ñ° **Fast-Track Approval Culture**: Business situations regularly lead to security approvals being expedited without proper review

**RAPID INDICATOR**: 4+ YES answers = HIGH RISK, 2-3 YES = MODERATE RISK, 0-1 YES = LOW RISK

---

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### **Documents to Request**
‚ñ° Last 12 months of security exception requests and approvals
‚ñ° Emergency change management procedures and recent examples
‚ñ° Crisis response documentation from last major incident/outage
‚ñ° Security incident reports from high-pressure periods (quarter-end, etc.)
‚ñ° Help desk tickets marked "urgent" or "emergency" from past 6 months

### **Demonstrations to Request**
‚ñ° **"Show me your emergency change process"** - walk through last urgent change
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate crisis security procedures"** - how security is maintained during outages
‚ñ° **"Walk through exception approval"** - how deadline-driven exceptions are handled

### **System Checks to Perform**
‚ñ° Review access logs during known high-pressure periods for unusual patterns
‚ñ° Check automated security control configurations for pressure-period adaptations
‚ñ° Examine monitoring alerts during crisis periods for security events
‚ñ° Verify security exception tracking and auto-expiration mechanisms

### **Interview Targets (15 min each)**
‚ñ° **IT Operations Manager**: Emergency change procedures and security shortcuts
‚ñ° **Department Heads**: How deadlines affect security compliance in their areas
‚ñ° **Security Team Lead**: Incident response quality under pressure vs. normal operations
‚ñ° **Project Managers**: Frequency and handling of deadline-driven security exceptions

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree - Follow Path to Score**

**START HERE** ‚Üí Does organization have formal crisis procedures that maintain critical security controls?

**NO** ‚Üí **RED (High Risk)**

**YES** ‚Üí Are security reviews required for emergency changes with <24hr exceptions only?

**NO** ‚Üí **RED (High Risk)**

**YES** ‚Üí Do >5 security exceptions get approved per quarter for deadline reasons?

**YES** ‚Üí **YELLOW (Moderate Risk)**

**NO** ‚Üí Is there documented security degradation during high-pressure periods?

**YES** ‚Üí **YELLOW (Moderate Risk)**

**NO** ‚Üí **GREEN (Low Risk)**

### **Scoring Criteria Summary**
- **GREEN (0)**: Formal crisis procedures maintain security + Emergency changes require security review + No pattern of pressure violations
- **YELLOW (1)**: Some shortcuts but with awareness + Emergency procedures occasionally bypass security + Periodic exceptions granted
- **RED (2)**: Regular bypasses during busy periods + No formal crisis procedures + Frequent exceptions with minimal review

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

| **Solution** | **Impact** | **Timeline** | **Cost** | **Dependencies** |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **Pressure-Resistant Security Checklists** | HIGH | Quick (2-4 weeks) | LOW | Security team time only |
| **Time-Boxed Security Exceptions** | HIGH | Quick (2-4 weeks) | LOW | Policy update, tracking system |
| **Automated Crisis Security Controls** | HIGH | Long (3-6 months) | MEDIUM | Technical implementation |
| **Crisis Security Champion Program** | MEDIUM | Medium (6-8 weeks) | LOW | Training program development |
| **Emergency Response Simulation Training** | MEDIUM | Medium (8-12 weeks) | MEDIUM | Training resources, time |
| **Pressure Period Monitoring** | LOW | Long (3-6 months) | HIGH | Advanced monitoring tools |

### **Immediate Actions (Week 1)**
1. Create simplified one-page security checklists for crisis situations
2. Implement 48-hour auto-expiration on all security exceptions
3. Designate security champions with crisis decision authority

### **Quick Wins (Month 1)**
1. Establish emergency change security review process (expedited, not bypassed)
2. Create security exception tracking dashboard with trend analysis
3. Conduct first crisis simulation including security maintenance requirements

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions**
- *"Tell me about your last major system outage - what happened to security procedures during the response?"*
- *"How often do departments come to you asking to bypass security for urgent deadlines?"*
- *"When you have an emergency IT change, what security steps get skipped to save time?"*

### **Follow-up Prompts for Incomplete Answers**
- **If they say "We always follow security"**: *"Can you show me the last three emergency changes and walk through exactly what security reviews were completed?"*
- **If they minimize pressure impact**: *"What happens to password policies and access controls during your busiest quarter-end period?"*
- **If they lack specific examples**: *"Let's look at your security exception requests from the last six months - which ones were deadline-driven?"*

### **Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"We don't track exceptions"** - Indicates lack of security exception visibility
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Everything is always urgent"** - Suggests chronic time pressure normalization  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Security slows us down"** - Shows pressure-security conflict awareness
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"IT handles security during emergencies"** - Possible security team bypass during crises

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics**
- Instead of *"You're failing security"* ‚Üí *"We've identified opportunities to strengthen security resilience during high-pressure periods"*
- Instead of *"Your people bypass security"* ‚Üí *"We can help streamline security processes to work better under operational pressure"*
- Instead of *"This is a serious vulnerability"* ‚Üí *"This represents a common challenge many organizations face - here's how to address it"*
