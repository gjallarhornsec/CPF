## Hyperbolic Discounting of Future Threats

---

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

□ **YES/NO**: Does organization allocate <40% of security budget to prevention/long-term measures?

□ **YES/NO**: Are critical security patches regularly delayed beyond 7 days without formal risk assessment?

□ **YES/NO**: Does emergency security spending exceed 40% of total annual security budget?

□ **YES/NO**: Is security strategic planning horizon less than 1 year?

□ **YES/NO**: Are there legacy systems with known vulnerabilities but no documented retirement timeline?

□ **YES/NO**: Is security training the first item cut during budget constraints?

□ **YES/NO**: After security incidents, does response focus almost entirely on immediate containment versus long-term improvements?

**SCORING**: 4+ YES answers = RED | 2-3 YES = YELLOW | 0-1 YES = GREEN

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING MATRIX (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:
```
START → Check prevention budget allocation:
├─ ≥60% prevention → Check patch management:
│  ├─ Patches within SLA → GREEN
│  └─ Regular delays → YELLOW
└─ <40% prevention → Check emergency spending:
   ├─ >40% emergency → RED
   └─ 20-40% emergency → Check planning horizon:
      ├─ ≥2 years stable → YELLOW  
      └─ <1 year/unstable → RED
```

### Objective Thresholds:
- **GREEN**: 60%+ prevention budget, <72hr critical patch deployment, <20% emergency spending
- **YELLOW**: 40-60% prevention budget, some documented patch delays, 20-40% emergency spending  
- **RED**: <40% prevention budget, regular undocumented delays, >40% emergency spending

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Walk me through your last major security budget decision."**
- *Follow-up*: "What drove the timeline for that decision?"
- *Red flag*: Answers focused only on immediate operational needs

**"How do you prioritize security patches when they conflict with operations?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Can you give me a recent specific example?"
- *Red flag*: No formal process or documentation

**"Describe your security planning process."**
- *Follow-up*: "How often do those plans change and why?"
- *Red flag*: Plans frequently modified for immediate pressures

### Sensitive Topic Approach:
**"Many organizations struggle with balancing immediate needs against future security investments. How does your organization handle this challenge?"**
- *Professional framing*: Normalize the challenge before exploring specifics
- *Non-judgmental*: Position as industry-wide issue, not organizational failure

### Deep Investigation Triggers:
- **Multiple emergency security purchases** → "What patterns do you see in these emergency situations?"
- **Frequent plan modifications** → "What typically drives changes to your security roadmap?"
- **Legacy system persistence** → "What would need to change to accelerate modernization timelines?"
