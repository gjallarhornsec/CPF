# CPF Category 2: Temporal Vulnerabilities

This category examines how time-related pressures and cognitive biases affect security decision-making, drawing from Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory (1979) and behavioral economics research. These vulnerabilities emerge when time constraints, deadlines, and temporal perceptions override rational security considerations.

## Subcategories

### 2.1 Urgency-Induced Security Bypass
The tendency to circumvent security protocols when faced with urgent requests or time-sensitive demands. Attackers exploit this by creating artificial deadlines that pressure victims into making hasty security decisions without proper verification, often leading to credential theft or unauthorized access.

### 2.2 Time Pressure Cognitive Degradation
The documented reduction in cognitive processing quality and decision-making capability under time constraints. This vulnerability results in impaired threat assessment, reduced attention to security details, and increased likelihood of overlooking malicious indicators in emails, links, or requests.

### 2.3 Deadline-Driven Risk Acceptance
The psychological shift toward accepting higher security risks when approaching project deadlines or time-sensitive deliverables. Organizations may disable security controls, approve exceptional access, or skip security reviews to meet temporal objectives, creating exploitable windows of vulnerability.

### 2.4 Present Bias in Security Investments
The cognitive tendency to prioritize immediate convenience over long-term security benefits. This manifests as underinvestment in security infrastructure, deferred security updates, and resistance to security measures that require current effort for future protection.

### 2.5 Hyperbolic Discounting of Future Threats
The human tendency to disproportionately discount future security risks compared to present inconveniences. This leads to inadequate preparation for emerging threats, poor security hygiene practices, and failure to implement preventive measures against slowly evolving attack campaigns.

### 2.6 Temporal Exhaustion Patterns
The cumulative degradation of security vigilance over extended periods of sustained work. This vulnerability creates predictable patterns where security monitoring effectiveness decreases during prolonged operations, making organizations susceptible to attacks during late-stage project phases.

### 2.7 Time-of-Day Vulnerability Windows
The systematic variation in security alertness and response capability based on circadian rhythms and work patterns. Attackers exploit known periods of reduced vigilance (early mornings, post-lunch hours, end-of-shift) to increase attack success rates.

### 2.8 Weekend/Holiday Security Lapses
The reduction in security staffing, monitoring intensity, and response readiness during non-business hours and holiday periods. This creates extended attack windows where intrusions may go undetected for longer durations, allowing attackers to establish deeper footholds.

### 2.9 Shift Change Exploitation Windows
The security coverage gaps and communication handoff vulnerabilities that occur during shift transitions. Attackers time their operations to exploit these brief periods where responsibility is ambiguous and situational awareness is temporarily reduced.

### 2.10 Temporal Consistency Pressure
The psychological need to maintain consistent behavior patterns over time, even when security circumstances change. This leads to outdated security practices, failure to adapt to new threats, and continued use of compromised systems or credentials.
