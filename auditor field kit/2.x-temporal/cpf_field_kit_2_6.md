# üìã INDICATOR 2.6 FIELD KIT: TEMPORAL EXHAUSTION PATTERNS

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES or NO for each item:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Do security team members regularly work shifts longer than 10 hours?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Does the organization have documented mandatory rest periods after major incidents?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Is there adequate security staffing during nights, weekends, and holidays (not just single-person coverage)?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Are there formal rotation procedures for incident response lasting over 8 hours?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Has the organization redistributed security workloads due to staff fatigue in the past 6 months?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Have security managers received training on recognizing team exhaustion in the past 12 months?

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Do security systems automatically adjust alerting or require additional approvals during extended work periods?

**Scoring Guide**: 5-7 YES = Green | 3-4 YES = Yellow | 0-2 YES = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Work schedule records** for security team (past 3 months)
- [ ] **Incident response logs** showing team rotation/hours worked
- [ ] **Fatigue management policy** or work hour limitations
- [ ] **Training records** for managers on exhaustion recognition
- [ ] **Holiday/weekend staffing schedules** (most recent)

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] **"Show me your process"** for handling 12+ hour security incidents
- [ ] **"Walk me through"** how you staff security during off-hours
- [ ] **"Demonstrate how"** your alerting system adapts during extended operations

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Review security monitoring** configurations for fatigue-aware features
- [ ] **Check workforce management** system for automated rest period enforcement
- [ ] **Examine alert logs** for response time patterns during different shifts

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **Security Operations Manager** (staffing policies, recent incidents)
- [ ] **SOC Analysts** (actual work hours, break procedures)
- [ ] **Incident Response Lead** (rotation practices, longest recent incident)
- [ ] **HR Representative** (rest period policies, overtime tracking)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here**: Are maximum shifts 10 hours or less with mandatory 10+ hour rest?
- **YES** ‚Üí Check adequate night/weekend staffing
  - **YES** ‚Üí Check formal incident rotation procedures
    - **YES** ‚Üí **GREEN** (if all other evidence supports)
    - **NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW**
  - **NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW**
- **NO** ‚Üí Check if any fatigue management policies exist
  - **YES** ‚Üí **YELLOW** (if inconsistently applied) or **RED** (if rarely enforced)
  - **NO** ‚Üí **RED**

### Objective Thresholds
- **GREEN**: Maximum 10-hour shifts, documented rest policies, full coverage during off-hours
- **YELLOW**: Some policies exist but inconsistent application, reduced but adequate coverage
- **RED**: Regular 12+ hour shifts, no rest policies, skeleton crews during vulnerable periods

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK WINS
- **Shift Length Limits** (High/Low) - Policy change, immediate implementation
- **Mandatory Rest Periods** (High/Low) - Clear rules, automated tracking
- **Alert System Adaptation** (High/Medium) - Configure existing systems for fatigue periods

### MEDIUM IMPACT / STRATEGIC
- **Follow-the-Sun Operations** (Medium/High) - Requires geographic distribution or partnerships
- **Automated Fatigue Management** (Medium/High) - New software systems, integration needed
- **Manager Training Program** (Medium/Low) - Develop curriculum, schedule sessions

### LONG-TERM / FOUNDATIONAL  
- **Cognitive Load Reduction Tools** (High/High) - Advanced decision support systems
- **Comprehensive Staffing Overhaul** (High/High) - Additional FTEs, budget approval required
- **Cultural Change Initiative** (Medium/High) - Organization-wide mindset shift, leadership commitment

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Walk me through your longest security incident in the past 6 months."**
- *Follow-up*: "How many hours did individual team members work? What rotation occurred?"

**"How do you ensure security coverage during nights and weekends?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Can you show me your staffing schedule for last holiday weekend?"

**"Tell me about a time when you had to adjust workloads because someone was overworked."**
- *Follow-up*: "How did you recognize the exhaustion? What specific actions did you take?"

### Red Flag Probes
**If they mention "dedication" or "going above and beyond":**
- "How do you balance team dedication with maintaining decision quality during extended periods?"

**If they report no fatigue issues:**
- "What would you do if an analyst worked 16 hours straight during an incident?"

**If coverage seems minimal:**
- "What's your backup plan if your night shift person becomes unavailable?"

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- Use: **"cognitive load management"** instead of "your people are exhausted"
- Use: **"decision quality assurance"** instead of "people make mistakes when tired"
- Use: **"operational sustainability"** instead of "you're burning people out"
