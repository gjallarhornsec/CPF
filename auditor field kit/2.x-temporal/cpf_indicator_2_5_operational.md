# CPF INDICATOR 2.5: Hyperbolic Discounting of Future Threats

## CONTEXT

Organizations systematically undervalue future security threats compared to immediate operational concerns, following a psychological pattern where delayed benefits are exponentially discounted. This creates vulnerability because attackers exploit predictable planning blind spots, targeting systems during low-preparation periods and using "slow burn" attacks that escalate below detection thresholds. The result is chronic underinvestment in preventive security measures while overreacting to immediate threats.

## ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

1. **Security Budget Allocation**: What percentage of your annual cybersecurity budget is allocated to immediate threat response versus future threat prevention? Tell us your specific breakdown and provide an example of a recent budget decision where you chose immediate response over long-term prevention.

2. **Patch Management Timing**: When critical security patches are released, how often are they delayed due to concerns about immediate operational disruption? Describe your most recent example where a security patch was postponed and explain the reasoning.

3. **Emergency vs. Planned Security Spending**: In the past 12 months, how many times did you make emergency security purchases compared to planned security investments? Give us a specific example of your most recent emergency security purchase and what drove that decision.

4. **Long-term Security Planning**: What is the longest time horizon you use for security strategic planning, and how often do these plans get shortened or modified due to immediate business pressures? Tell us about a recent instance where long-term security plans were altered for immediate concerns.

5. **Legacy System Management**: How do you decide when to modernize or retire legacy systems with known security vulnerabilities? Provide a specific example of a legacy system in your environment and explain why it hasn't been upgraded despite known risks.

6. **Security Training Investment**: When budget constraints occur, which gets cut first: immediate security tools or future-focused security training and awareness programs? Give us your most recent example of this type of budget decision.

7. **Incident Response vs. Prevention**: After a security incident, do you typically invest more in preventing similar immediate threats or in comprehensive long-term security improvements? Tell us about your response to your most recent security incident as a specific example.

- Strategic security planning horizon â‰¥2 years with <25% plan modifications
- Documented legacy system retirement roadmap with timelines
- Security training protected even during budget cuts
- Post-incident investments include both immediate and long-term improvements

**Yellow (1) - Moderate Vulnerability:**
- 40-60% of security budget on prevention/long-term measures  
- Some security patches delayed but with documented business justification
- Emergency security spending 20-40% of total annual spending
- 1-2 year planning horizon with 25-50% plan modifications
- Legacy systems identified but retirement timeline unclear
- Security training reduced during budget constraints but not eliminated
- Post-incident response primarily immediate with some long-term elements

**Red (2) - High Vulnerability:**
- <40% of security budget on prevention/long-term measures
- Regular patch delays due to operational concerns without formal risk assessment
- Emergency security spending >40% of total annual spending
- <1 year planning horizon or >50% plan modifications due to immediate pressures
- No clear legacy system retirement strategy
- Security training first to be cut during budget constraints
- Post-incident response almost entirely focused on immediate threat containment

## RISK SCENARIOS

**Scenario 1: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Exploitation**
Attackers identify organizations with poor long-term planning patterns and establish persistent access during predictable low-security periods (budget cycles, holiday seasons). They gradually escalate privileges over months while the organization remains focused on immediate operational concerns, ultimately resulting in complete data exfiltration or ransomware deployment during peak business periods.

**Scenario 2: Supply Chain Temporal Attack**
Cybercriminals compromise third-party vendors knowing that target organizations defer supply chain security assessments due to immediate integration pressures. The attack activates 12-18 months later when the organization has become dependent on the compromised vendor, maximizing impact while exploiting the temporal disconnect between procurement and security validation.

**Scenario 3: Regulatory Compliance Cascade Failure**
Organizations consistently defer compliance-related security investments until regulatory deadlines approach. Attackers time their attacks to coincide with these high-pressure compliance periods when security teams are overwhelmed with immediate requirements, unable to address evolving threats, resulting in both security breaches and regulatory violations.

**Scenario 4: Infrastructure Modernization Exploitation**
Attackers target legacy systems that organizations maintain due to immediate migration costs versus future security benefits. These systems become increasingly vulnerable over time while patches are delayed for operational stability, ultimately providing attackers with entry points into modern infrastructure through lateral movement from compromised legacy systems.
