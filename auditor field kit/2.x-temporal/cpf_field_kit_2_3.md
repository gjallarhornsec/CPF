# üìã CPF INDICATOR 2.3 FIELD KIT
## Deadline-driven Risk Acceptance

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 min)

**Check all that apply - Observable evidence only:**

- [ ] **Security Exception Logs**: Organization maintains formal logs of security exceptions requested for deadline purposes (last 6 months)
- [ ] **Patch Delay Documentation**: Written evidence of security patches delayed due to deadline concerns (last 6 months)  
- [ ] **Training Completion Data**: Security training completion rates drop >15% during known deadline periods
- [ ] **Unauthorized Tool Usage**: Help desk tickets or system logs show increased personal device/cloud service usage during deadline periods
- [ ] **Emergency Access Requests**: Pattern of elevated access requests clustering around project deadlines
- [ ] **Project Manager Authority**: Written policy exists defining project manager authority to override security requirements
- [ ] **Incident Response Delays**: Security incident investigation completion times increase during high-pressure periods

**Quick Score**: 
- 0-1 checked = Green | 2-4 checked = Yellow | 5+ checked = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 min)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] Security exception request logs (past 6 months)
- [ ] Project management procedures mentioning security requirements
- [ ] Patch management schedules showing any protection windows
- [ ] Help desk ticket summaries for deadline-related requests
- [ ] Security training completion reports by month/quarter

### System Demonstrations Needed
- [ ] "Show me your process for emergency access requests"
- [ ] "Walk me through what happens when patches conflict with go-live dates"
- [ ] "Demonstrate how security checkpoints appear in your project timelines"

### Key Interviews
- [ ] **Project Manager**: Recent deadline vs. security trade-off decisions
- [ ] **IT Security Lead**: Exception approval process and frequency
- [ ] **Help Desk Manager**: Unusual request patterns during deadline periods
- [ ] **Department Head**: Authority to override security for deadlines

### System Checks
- [ ] Review access logs during last major deadline period
- [ ] Check security tool usage statistics during deadline vs. normal periods
- [ ] Examine backup completion rates during high-pressure periods
- [ ] Verify patch deployment schedules against project timelines

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 min)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE**: Are security exceptions formally requested for deadline purposes?

**If NO** ‚Üí Check training completion consistency
- Consistent across deadline/normal periods? ‚Üí **GREEN**
- >15% drop during deadlines? ‚Üí **YELLOW**

**If YES** ‚Üí How frequently?
- Monthly or more ‚Üí **RED**
- Quarterly or less ‚Üí Check approval process
  - Formal executive approval required? ‚Üí **YELLOW**  
  - Informal or project manager approval? ‚Üí **RED**

### Override Criteria
**Automatic RED** if any:
- [ ] Project managers can override security without executive approval
- [ ] Regular pattern of "temporary" security bypasses
- [ ] Security incident response quality degrades during deadline periods

**Automatic GREEN** if all:
- [ ] Zero security exceptions granted for deadline purposes (6 months)
- [ ] Training completion rates stable year-round
- [ ] Incident response times consistent regardless of deadline pressure

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 min)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Timeline-Integrated Security** (Low Cost)
  - Add security checkpoints to project management software
  - Require security sign-off before milestone completion
- **Authority Matrix Clarification** (Low Cost)  
  - Document who can approve security exceptions
  - Remove informal override authorities

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MODERATE IMPLEMENTATION
- **Deadline-Aware Automation** (Medium Cost)
  - Deploy enhanced monitoring during deadline periods
  - Automate patch deployment with rollback capabilities
- **Stress-Period Protocols** (Medium Cost)
  - Increase help desk staffing during deadline windows
  - Send targeted security reminders before major deadlines

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM IMPLEMENTATION
- **Cultural Transformation** (High Cost)
  - Integrate security metrics into project success criteria
  - Train leadership on psychological impact of deadline pressure
- **Advanced Monitoring** (High Cost)
  - Implement behavioral analytics for deadline period vulnerabilities
  - Deploy AI-powered threat detection during high-risk windows

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 min)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your most recent major deadline - quarter-end, product launch, or regulatory filing."**

**Follow-up**: "What happened to security processes during that period?"

### Probing Questions
- **"Who has the authority to say 'skip security for now, we'll fix it later'?"**
- **"How often do teams ask for temporary security exceptions?"**
- **"What's different about security during your busy periods versus normal times?"**

### Red Flag Responses
- "Security just has to understand business priorities"
- "We always clean up security issues after the deadline"  
- "Everyone knows deadlines come first"
- "IT Security needs to be more flexible"

### Professional Follow-ups
- **"Can you show me how security checkpoints are built into project plans?"**
- **"What's your process for ensuring temporary exceptions get reversed?"**
- **"How do you measure security consistency across different time periods?"**
