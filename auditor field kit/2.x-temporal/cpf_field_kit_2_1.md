# üìã CPF FIELD KIT 2.1: Urgency-Induced Security Bypass

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

- [ ] **YES/NO**: Organization has documented emergency access procedures with automatic time limits
- [ ] **YES/NO**: Senior leadership requests bypass normal security procedures during urgent situations  
- [ ] **YES/NO**: Emergency access usage increases significantly during quarter-end/year-end periods
- [ ] **YES/NO**: Security incidents correlate with high-pressure deadline periods
- [ ] **YES/NO**: Employees share credentials or use unauthorized tools during tight deadlines
- [ ] **YES/NO**: Security reviews are regularly skipped or expedited under time pressure
- [ ] **YES/NO**: Organization tracks security exception requests relative to business calendar

**Quick Risk Assessment**: 
- **0-2 YES answers**: Proceed to evidence collection
- **3-4 YES answers**: High priority assessment required
- **5-7 YES answers**: Critical vulnerability present

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] Emergency access policies and procedures
- [ ] Security exception logs (past 12 months)
- [ ] Emergency access usage logs (past 12 months)
- [ ] Recent incident reports with timestamps
- [ ] Change management logs during recent deadline periods

### System Demonstrations
- [ ] **"Show me how emergency access is granted"**
- [ ] **"Walk through your last urgent security exception"**
- [ ] **"Demonstrate what happens when executives need immediate access"**
- [ ] **"Show logs of security reviews during deadline periods"**

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **IT Security Manager**: Emergency procedures and override frequency
- [ ] **IT Operations Staff**: Pressure to bypass during deadlines
- [ ] **Department Heads**: Examples of urgent access requests
- [ ] **Help Desk**: Emergency access call patterns

### System Checks
- [ ] Review authentication logs for shared account spikes
- [ ] Check emergency access account activity patterns
- [ ] Examine security alert response times during busy periods
- [ ] Verify automatic access revocation functionality

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here**: Does organization have emergency procedures?

**IF NO** ‚Üí **RED (2 points)**

**IF YES** ‚Üí Continue to next question:

**Are emergency procedures bypassed during pressure?**
- **Regularly bypassed** ‚Üí **RED (2 points)**
- **Sometimes bypassed** ‚Üí Continue to correlation check
- **Rarely bypassed** ‚Üí Continue to correlation check

**Is there correlation between deadlines and security incidents?**
- **Clear pattern exists** ‚Üí **RED (2 points)**
- **Some correlation** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1 point)**
- **No correlation** ‚Üí **GREEN (0 points)**

### Override Criteria
- **Leadership frequently demands overrides** ‚Üí **RED**
- **Credential sharing is common during deadlines** ‚Üí **RED**
- **>30% increase in emergency access during deadline periods** ‚Üí **RED**

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT - Quick Implementation
- [ ] **Automated Emergency Access** (LOW cost, 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Executive Bypass Prevention** (MED cost, 4-6 weeks)
- [ ] **Deadline Buffer Policy** (LOW cost, 1-2 weeks)

### MEDIUM IMPACT - Medium Term  
- [ ] **Stress-Period Monitoring** (MED cost, 6-8 weeks)
- [ ] **Urgency Recognition Training** (LOW cost, 8-12 weeks)
- [ ] **Crisis Response Integration** (HIGH cost, 12-16 weeks)

### Dependencies

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Can you walk me through what happens when someone needs emergency access during your busiest periods?"**

**Follow-ups:**
- "How often does this actually happen?"
- "Who typically makes these requests?"
- "What's the approval process?"

### Pressure Point Questions  
**"Tell me about the last time a senior executive needed immediate access to something that normally requires additional security steps."**

**Follow-ups:**
- "What was the business justification?"
- "How long did the process take?"
- "Were any normal procedures modified?"

### Red Flag Indicators
- **Vague responses** about emergency procedures
- **"We trust our people"** instead of documented controls
- **Multiple examples** of recent bypasses
- **Defensive reactions** to bypass questions
- **No correlation tracking** between deadlines and security

### Professional Probes
**"During high-pressure periods, what security procedures are typically adjusted to meet deadlines?"**

**"How does your organization verify urgent requests that appear to come from leadership?"**
