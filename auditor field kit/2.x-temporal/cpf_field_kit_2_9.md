# 📋 CPF FIELD KIT 2.9: SHIFT CHANGE EXPLOITATION

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check each item - Answer YES/NO only:**

□ **Written handoff procedures exist** that specifically mention security responsibilities
□ **Shift overlap periods are 15+ minutes** with both personnel actively present
□ **Clear primary responsibility assignment** exists for security during handoffs
□ **Security incidents show no correlation** with shift change timing (past 6 months)
□ **Alert monitoring systems continue operating** without gaps during handoffs
□ **Shift schedules are varied/non-predictable** or not publicly accessible
□ **Verification process exists** to confirm security status transfer completion

**SCORING**: 
- 6-7 YES = GREEN (0)
- 4-5 YES = YELLOW (1) 
- 0-3 YES = RED (2)

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
□ Written handoff procedures for security-critical roles
□ Shift schedules for past 3 months
□ Security incident log with timestamps (past 6 months)
□ Handoff completion checklists (past month)
□ Training records for shift change procedures

### Demonstrations to Request
□ "Show me your actual handoff process for [SOC analyst/security guard/IT ops]"
□ "Walk through what happens when an alert comes in during shift change"
□ "Show me how you verify security status was transferred"

### System Checks to Perform
□ Review alert monitoring systems for handoff gaps
□ Check automated escalation procedures during transitions
□ Verify dashboard systems used for handoff support
□ Test backup monitoring activation during shifts

### Key Interview Targets
□ Outgoing shift supervisor
□ Incoming shift supervisor  
□ Security operations personnel
□ Recent hire (within 6 months)

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE:**
1. Are there written security handoff procedures? 
   - NO → **RED (2)**
   - YES → Continue

2. Is there 15+ minute overlap with dual coverage?
   - NO → Check incident correlation
   - YES → Continue

3. Do security incidents correlate with shift timing?
   - YES → **RED (2)**
   - NO → Continue

4. Are all 7 quick assessment items YES?
   - 6-7 YES → **GREEN (0)**
   - 4-5 YES → **YELLOW (1)**
   - 0-3 YES → **RED (2)**

### Objective Thresholds
- **Incident Correlation**: >20% of incidents within 30 min of shift change = RED
- **Overlap Time**: <5 min = RED, 5-14 min = YELLOW, 15+ min = GREEN
- **Schedule Predictability**: Same times daily = RED, some variation = YELLOW, randomized = GREEN

## 🔧 SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
□ **Security-focused handoff checklists** (Cost: Low, Time: 2 weeks)
□ **15-minute overlap mandate** (Cost: Medium, Time: 1 week)
□ **Explicit responsibility assignment** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
□ **Automated handoff support systems** (Cost: High, Time: 3-6 months)
□ **Schedule randomization program** (Cost: Medium, Time: 2-3 months)
□ **Dual responsibility model** (Cost: Medium, Time: 1-2 months)

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MAINTENANCE
□ **Regular handoff audits** (Cost: Low, Time: Ongoing)
□ **Cross-training programs** (Cost: Medium, Time: 3-6 months)
□ **Performance metrics tracking** (Cost: Low, Time: Ongoing)

### Dependencies
- **Technology solutions** require budget approval and IT resources
- **Schedule changes** require union/HR coordination
- **Training programs** require management commitment and time allocation

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
- "Walk me through what happens during a typical shift change for your security team."
- "How do you ensure security monitoring continues during handoffs?"
- "Have you noticed any patterns in when security incidents occur?"

### Follow-up Prompts
**If they mention informal processes:**
- "Can you show me the written procedure for that?"
- "How do you train new people on this process?"

**If they mention gaps or delays:**
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What's your backup plan when this occurs?"

**If they seem defensive:**
- "This is a common challenge across many organizations. What works well in your current process?"

### Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation
□ Vague answers about who's responsible during handoffs
□ Mentions of "it usually works fine" without specifics
□ No awareness of shift timing correlation with incidents
□ Resistance to showing actual handoff procedures
□ Different answers from different shift personnel

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
**Instead of:** "Your security is vulnerable during shift changes"
**Say:** "We're looking at opportunities to strengthen continuity during transitions"

**Instead of:** "This is a major security gap"
**Say:** "This represents an area for security enhancement"
