## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Required Documents
‚ñ° **Last 3 years IT budget breakdowns** (security vs operational spending)  
‚ñ° **Recent project scope change documentation** (security requirement modifications)  
‚ñ° **Patch management logs** (last 6 months)  
‚ñ° **Security training schedules** (current + historical)  
‚ñ° **Emergency purchase request examples** (security vs operational)  

### System Demonstrations
‚ñ° **"Show me your patch approval process"** - time from release to deployment  
‚ñ° **"Walk through your last security tool replacement decision"** - approval timeline  
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate your ROI calculation for security vs operational investments"**  

### Interview Targets

‚ñ° **CISO/Security Manager**: Investment approval experiences  
‚ñ° **IT Operations Manager**: Patch management and system update processes  
‚ñ° **Project Manager**: Security requirement change experiences  

### Observable Checks
‚ñ° **Security tool licenses**: Check for expired/cancelled subscriptions  
‚ñ° **Training completion rates**: Compare current vs 2 years ago  
‚ñ° **Risk register**: Count deferred security items vs operational items

### Decision Tree

**START HERE** ‚Üì

**Check Budget Trend**:
- Security spending **maintained/increased** as % of IT budget ‚Üí **Continue**
- Security spending **decreased** as % of IT budget ‚Üí **RED (2 points)**

**Check Patch Management**:
- Patches applied **within vendor timelines** ‚Üí **Continue**  
- Patches **regularly delayed** beyond vendor timelines ‚Üí **Add 1 point**

**Check Training Consistency**:
- Security training **maintained consistent schedule** ‚Üí **Continue**
- Security training **frequency reduced/eliminated** ‚Üí **Add 1 point**

**Check Investment Process**:

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Can you walk me through your last major budget reduction?"**
- *Follow-up*: "What percentage of security vs operational projects were delayed?"
- *Red flag*: If security cuts disproportionately high

**"Tell me about your most recent critical security update."**
- *Follow-up*: "How long from vendor release to deployment?"
- *Red flag*: If delays exceed 30 days for critical patches

**"How do you justify ROI for security investments?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Do you have a template I can see?"
- *Red flag*: If no formal process exists

### Probing Questions for Yellow/Red Indicators
**"When security requirements add cost to projects, what typically happens?"**
- *Listen for*: Requirements removed, scope reduced, deferrals

**"How has your security training schedule changed in the past two years?"**
- *Listen for*: Frequency reductions, cancellations, budget cuts

**"Can you show me your security tool replacement process?"**
- *Listen for*: Delays, extended lifecycles, manual processes

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of**: "You're being short-sighted about security"
- **Say**: "I'm seeing some optimization opportunities in your security investment timing"

- **Instead of**: "Your organization has present bias"  
- **Say**: "There may be opportunities to balance immediate and long-term security value"

- **Instead of**: "This is a critical vulnerability"
- **Say**: "This represents a gap in your risk management approach"
