# üìã INDICATOR 4.7 FIELD KIT: ANXIETY-TRIGGERED MISTAKES

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each item:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security incidents increase during deadline periods, audits, or organizational changes
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization has documented procedures specifically for maintaining security during high-stress periods  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Employees regularly skip security steps when under time pressure
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: "Urgent" security requests bypass normal verification procedures
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security training effectiveness drops during busy/stressful periods
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Management acknowledges security "takes a backseat" during crises
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: No specific monitoring for stress-related security errors exists

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] **Security incident logs** for past 12 months with timestamps
- [ ] **Training attendance records** during busy periods
- [ ] **Emergency/crisis response procedures** (security-specific)
- [ ] **Deadline project documentation** showing security protocols
- [ ] **Employee stress/wellness policies** mentioning security

### Demonstrations to Request:
- [ ] **"Show me what happens"** when urgent security alert received
- [ ] **Walk through** security protocols during simulated deadline pressure
- [ ] **Demonstrate** emergency security procedures
- [ ] **Show** monitoring systems for unusual activity patterns

### System Checks to Perform:
- [ ] **Review alert logs** for patterns during known stress periods
- [ ] **Check authentication failures** correlating with organizational events
- [ ] **Examine help desk tickets** during busy periods
- [ ] **Test** if additional verification triggers exist during stress

### Interview Targets:
- [ ] **IT Security Manager**: stress-related incident patterns
- [ ] **Project Managers**: security compliance during deadlines
- [ ] **Front-line Employees**: pressure to skip security steps
- [ ] **HR Representative**: stress management and security training

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**IF** 4+ Quick Assessment items are YES ‚Üí **RED (2)**

**IF** 2-3 Quick Assessment items are YES ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**  

**IF** 0-1 Quick Assessment items are YES ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**

### Validation Checks:
- **RED confirmed if**: Clear incident spikes during stress periods + No stress-specific procedures
- **YELLOW confirmed if**: Some stress awareness + Mixed evidence of impact  
- **GREEN confirmed if**: Documented stress procedures + No correlation between stress/incidents

| **Multi-person approval during high-stress** | Low | Low | 1 week |

### MEDIUM IMPACT (Implement Second):
| Solution | Cost | Complexity | Timeline |
|----------|------|------------|----------|
| **Automated stress-period monitoring** | Medium | High | 2-3 months |
| **Anxiety management training** | Medium | Medium | 1-2 months |
| **Environmental stress reduction** | High | Low | 3-6 months |

### LONG-TERM (Strategic):
| Solution | Cost | Complexity | Timeline |
|----------|------|------------|----------|
| **Psychological safety programs** | Medium | High | 6-12 months |

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Question:
*"Can you tell me about a recent time when your team was under significant pressure? How did security protocols hold up during that period?"*

### Follow-up Prompts:
- **If they mention shortcuts**: *"What specific security steps typically get skipped?"*
- **If they mention incidents**: *"How often do security issues occur during your busy periods compared to normal times?"*
- **If they seem defensive**: *"This is very common - most organizations see some impact. What we're looking for is how well you manage it."*

### Red Flag Indicators:
- **"We trust people to do the right thing"** (no procedures)
- **"Security can't slow us down during crises"** (explicit deprioritization)  
- **"People just need to be more careful"** (no systematic approach)
- **"We've never tracked that"** (no awareness of patterns)

### Professional Closing:
*"Based on what I'm seeing, this is an area where some focused attention could significantly reduce your risk profile. Would you like me to prioritize solutions that could be implemented quickly?"*
