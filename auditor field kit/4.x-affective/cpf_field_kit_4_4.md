# üìã CPF INDICATOR 4.4 FIELD KIT
## Legacy System Attachment Assessment

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES if condition exists:**

‚ñ° **Past Support Systems**: Organization has systems running >6 months past vendor security support end-of-life

‚ñ° **Policy Exemptions**: Legacy systems receive regular exemptions from standard security policies (patching, monitoring, access controls)

‚ñ° **Single Points of Failure**: Critical systems depend on 1-2 people for maintenance/operation knowledge

‚ñ° **Replacement Delays**: System replacement decisions consistently take >18 months from identification to deployment

‚ñ° **Budget Imbalance**: >60% of IT maintenance budget goes to legacy systems vs. new system investment

‚ñ° **Defensive Responses**: Staff show strong emotional resistance when legacy system changes are proposed

‚ñ° **Extended Contracts**: Organization pays premium prices for extended support on systems past normal lifecycle

**SCORING**: 0-1 YES = Green | 2-4 YES = Yellow | 5-7 YES = Red

---

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
‚ñ° **Asset inventory** with system ages and support status
‚ñ° **Last 12 months of security policy exemption requests**
‚ñ° **Most recent IT budget breakdown** (maintenance vs. new systems)
‚ñ° **System replacement project timelines** from past 2 years
‚ñ° **Staff training records** for critical legacy systems

### System Checks to Perform
‚ñ° **Identify oldest system** currently in production
‚ñ° **Count systems** running past vendor security support
‚ñ° **Review network segmentation** for legacy system isolation
‚ñ° **Check monitoring coverage** on legacy systems vs. modern systems

### Demonstration Requests
‚ñ° **"Show me your process** for deciding when to replace a system"
‚ñ° **"Walk me through** your most recent legacy system security incident"
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate how you handle** vendor support end-of-life notifications"

### Interview Targets
‚ñ° **IT Operations Manager**: System lifecycle processes
‚ñ° **Security Team Lead**: Policy exemption decisions
‚ñ° **Budget/Finance Contact**: Legacy system cost allocation
‚ñ° **Senior System Admin**: Day-to-day legacy operations

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE** ‚Üí Count systems past security support lifecycle:

**0 systems past support** ‚Üí Check policy exemptions:
- No exemptions = **GREEN**
- Occasional exemptions with formal approval = **YELLOW**

**1-3 systems past support** ‚Üí Check timeline patterns:
- Replacements typically <12 months = **YELLOW**
- Replacements typically >18 months = **RED**

**4+ systems past support** ‚Üí Automatic **RED**

**OVERRIDE CONDITIONS** (force RED regardless of above):
- Any system >2 years past vendor support
- Critical systems with single-person dependency
- Strong emotional resistance to system changes documented

### LONG-TERM - High Implementation
‚ñ° **Replacement Planning** (Cost: High)
  - Phased replacement methodology
  - Change management integration
  - Dependencies: Budget approval, vendor selection

‚ñ° **Executive Engagement** (Cost: Medium)
  - Business impact risk reporting
  - Competitive analysis integration
  - Dependencies: Executive sponsorship

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"How do you currently track when vendor support ends for your systems?"**
- *Follow-up*: "What happens when you get those notifications?"

**"Walk me through your most recent system replacement project."**
- *Follow-up*: "What took the longest - technical work or decision making?"

**"Tell me about your oldest system still in production."**
- *Follow-up*: "How many people know how to maintain it?"

### Red Flag Indicators
‚ñ° **Emotional language** about systems ("our baby," "reliable old friend")
‚ñ° **Rationalization patterns** ("it's too critical to change")
‚ñ° **Knowledge hoarding** ("only Bob knows how it works")
‚ñ° **Cost avoidance** ("replacement would be too expensive")

### Professional Responses to Resistance
**If defensive**: *"I understand these systems have served you well. Let's look at how to protect that investment while managing security risks."*

**If dismissive**: *"What would happen to operations if this system failed unexpectedly?"*

**If cost-focused**: *"Let's calculate the total cost of the next security incident versus planned replacement."*
