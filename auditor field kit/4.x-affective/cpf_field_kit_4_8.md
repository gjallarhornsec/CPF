## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization has written policies for adjusting security requirements during high-stress periods (crises, layoffs, peak workloads)

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Incident reporting system allows anonymous submissions and focuses on learning rather than punishment

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization provides confidential employee assistance programs (EAP) or mental health resources

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Managers receive training on recognizing employee distress without violating privacy

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security compliance rates vary less than 15% between high-stress and normal periods

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- **Crisis security protocols** or emergency procedures
- **Incident reporting statistics** (frequency, types, follow-up actions)
- **EAP utilization reports** (anonymized)
- **Manager training materials** on employee support
- **Security compliance metrics** by time period
- **Help desk ticket analysis** for security-related requests

### Demonstrations to Request:
- **"Show me how someone reports a security incident"** (walk through actual system)
- **"Show me your security dashboard during our last busy period"** (crisis metrics)
- **"Walk me through what happens when someone misses security training"** (response process)

### System Checks to Perform:
- **Anonymous reporting functionality** (test if available)
- **Password complexity requirements** vs. available tools (password managers)
- **MFA configuration** for ease of use
- **Security alert/notification systems** for cognitive load

### Interview Targets:
- **HR Manager** (employee support programs)
- **IT Help Desk Lead** (security-related support requests)
- **Security Team Lead** (incident response, policy flexibility)
- **Department Manager** (workload impact on security compliance)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**START HERE**: Does organization have anonymous incident reporting AND stress-aware security policies?

**‚Üí YES**: Check compliance variation
- **Less than 15% variation** between stress/normal periods = **GREEN (0)**
- **15-25% variation** OR mixed policy implementation = **YELLOW (1)**
- **More than 25% variation** OR poor implementation = **RED (2)**

**‚Üí NO**: Check available support resources
- **Strong EAP + manager training + flexible policies** = **YELLOW (1)**
- **Some resources but inconsistent** = **YELLOW (1)**
- **No mental health resources + blame culture** = **RED (2)**

**RED FLAGS** (automatic RED scoring):
- Employees afraid to report security mistakes
- No mental health resources available
- Punishment-focused incident response
- Security requirements never adjusted for stress periods

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Tell me about your busiest or most stressful period in the last year. How did security compliance change during that time?"**

- "Did you notice more help desk tickets or security questions?"
- "How did management respond to any security lapses during this period?"

### Incident Response Questions:
**"Walk me through what happens when someone reports clicking a suspicious link or making a security mistake."**

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Is there a way to report this anonymously?"
- "What's the typical response time and follow-up process?"
- "How comfortable do employees seem with reporting mistakes?"

### Support Resource Questions:
**"What resources does your organization provide when employees are struggling with workload or stress?"**

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "How do managers know when someone might need support?"
