# üìã CPF INDICATOR 4.6 FIELD KIT
## Guilt-driven Overcompliance Assessment

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Routine security decisions require 3+ approval levels
‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Security documentation consistently exceeds official requirements by 25%+  
‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Staff request written confirmation for previously trained procedures weekly+
‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Incident response delayed >30 minutes for authorization during last event
‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - No clear process exists for justified procedure deviations
‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Security mistakes trigger blame/discipline rather than learning discussions
‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Employees frequently volunteer for extra security training beyond requirements

**Quick Score:** 0-1 YES = Green | 2-4 YES = Yellow | 5-7 YES = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- **Decision approval matrix** for security functions
- **Last 3 incident response reports** with timeline details
- **Sample security task documentation** vs. official templates
- **Recent security policy clarification emails/tickets**
- **Post-incident review reports** from last 6 months

### Demonstration Requests
- **"Show me your process"** for routine password reset
- **"Walk through"** last security incident response timeline
- **"Demonstrate"** how staff document a standard security task
- **"Explain"** procedure for emergency security decisions

### System Checks
- **Approval workflow systems** - count required steps for routine tasks
- **Documentation repositories** - measure actual vs. required documentation
- **Incident tracking systems** - review response time patterns
- **Training records** - identify voluntary vs. mandatory completions

### Interview Targets
- **Security team lead** (decision-making authority)
- **Junior security staff** (approval-seeking patterns)  
- **IT help desk** (routine security requests)
- **Compliance officer** (documentation requirements)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree Scoring

**START HERE:** Count approval levels for routine security decisions

```
Routine Decisions:
‚îú‚îÄ 1-2 approvals ‚Üí Check incident response time
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ <30 min response ‚Üí GREEN (continue monitoring)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ >30 min response ‚Üí YELLOW (process review needed)
‚îú‚îÄ 2-3 approvals ‚Üí Check documentation patterns  
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Normal documentation ‚Üí YELLOW (streamline approvals)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Excessive documentation ‚Üí RED (immediate intervention)
‚îî‚îÄ 3+ approvals ‚Üí RED (systematic overcompliance detected)
```

**Override to RED if ANY present:**
- Incident response paralysis (>2 hours delay)
- No deviation process exists
- Blame culture for mistakes evident
- Daily policy clarification requests

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT - Quick Implementation
- **Decision Authority Matrix** (Cost: Low, Time: 2 weeks)
  - Define clear decision levels for routine tasks
  - Eliminate redundant approval layers
- **Time-Boxed Incident Response** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)
  - Pre-authorize standard containment actions
  - Remove approval delays for first 60 minutes

### MEDIUM IMPACT - Moderate Implementation  
- **Documentation Right-Sizing** (Cost: Medium, Time: 4-6 weeks)
  - Audit and eliminate excessive reporting requirements
  - Implement template-based documentation limits
- **Procedure Deviation Framework** (Cost: Medium, Time: 6-8 weeks)
  - Create formal process for justified deviations
  - Establish peer review instead of hierarchical approval

### HIGH IMPACT - Long-term Implementation
- **Psychological Safety Protocols** (Cost: Medium, Time: 3-6 months)
  - Implement no-blame incident reviews  
  - Quarterly adaptive security thinking workshops
- **Cognitive Load Management** (Cost: High, Time: 6-12 months)
  - Automate routine compliance tasks
  - Protect security staff focus time during high-risk periods

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your last security incident response..."**
- *Follow-up:* "What caused any delays in taking action?"
- *Red Flag:* Mentions waiting for approval, seeking authorization

**"How do your security staff handle routine decisions like password resets?"**
- *Follow-up:* "How many people need to approve that?"
- *Red Flag:* Multiple approval layers, uncertainty about authority

**"What happens when someone makes a security mistake here?"**
- *Follow-up:* "Can you give me a recent example?"
- *Red Flag:* Blame language, formal discipline, public attribution

### Probing Questions
**"Do employees ever ask for extra security training?"**
- *Follow-up:* "What reasons do they give?"
- *Red Flag:* Anxiety-driven requests, frequent repetition

**"How often do staff ask for written confirmation of procedures they've been trained on?"**
- *Follow-up:* "What kinds of procedures?"
- *Red Flag:* Weekly requests, basic procedures, multiple confirmations

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of:** "Your staff seem anxious and overcompliant"
- **Say:** "I'm seeing opportunities to streamline your security decision processes"

- **Instead of:** "This creates security vulnerabilities"  
- **Say:** "This pattern can impact incident response effectiveness"

- **Instead of:** "Your culture is blame-focused"
- **Say:** "Your post-incident processes could benefit from a learning-focused approach"
