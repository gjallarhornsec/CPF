## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Instructions**: Check YES/NO based on observable evidence only. No interpretation required.

| # | Assessment Question | YES | NO | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Does written incident response documentation include specific procedures for managing team stress/emotions during security events? | ‚òê | ‚òê | Review incident response playbooks |

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**START HERE** ‚Üí Count total YES responses from Quick Assessment

**7 YES responses** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**
- All systems present for managing emotional contagion

**4-6 YES responses** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**  
- Some systems present but gaps in coverage

**0-3 YES responses** ‚Üí **RED (2)**
- Inadequate systems for managing emotional contagion

### Automatic RED Triggers (Override above scoring)
- [ ] Client reports multiple security errors during last major incident
- [ ] No documented incident response emotional management procedures  
- [ ] Leadership admits to "panicking" teams during crises
- [ ] Help desk shows >200% volume spike during last security event with no management protocol

### Scoring Confidence Check
- [ ] **High Confidence**: Clear evidence supports score
- [ ] **Medium Confidence**: Some evidence unclear, score reasonable
- [ ] **Low Confidence**: Insufficient evidence, note for follow-up

**FINAL SCORE**: ‚òê Green (0) ‚òê Yellow (1) ‚òê Red (2)

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your last major security incident - what happened and how did your team respond emotionally?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Did you notice stress or anxiety spreading between team members?"
- *Red flag*: Mentions of panic, multiple simultaneous errors, communication breakdown

**"How does leadership typically communicate during security crises?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Can you show me an example of crisis communication?"
- *Red flag*: Emotional language, urgent/panicked tone, blame

**"Have you ever noticed multiple people making security mistakes around the same time?"**
- *Follow-up*: "How often does this happen? What triggers it?"
- *Red flag*: Monthly or more frequent, no recognition of pattern

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of**: "Your team panics during incidents"
- **Say**: "We're assessing how organizational stress affects security decision-making"

- **Instead of**: "Your leadership creates anxiety" 
- **Say**: "We're reviewing communication effectiveness during high-pressure situations"

- **Instead of**: "People make emotional decisions"
- **Say**: "We're examining decision-making processes during time-sensitive security events"

### Probing Questions for Incomplete Answers
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What typically happens next in that situation?"
- "Who else would be involved in that process?"
- "How do you currently measure the effectiveness of that approach?"
