## Fear-based Decision Paralysis

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Organization has documented time limits for critical security decisions (patches, incidents)

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Clear decision authority matrix exists specifying who can approve different security actions

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Emergency bypass procedures exist for after-hours/crisis situations

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Incident response playbooks include pre-authorized actions (no additional approvals needed)

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Security team can show evidence of decisions made within 72 hours for critical patches

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Less than 15% of routine security decisions require escalation beyond designated authority

‚ñ° **YES** / ‚ñ° **NO** - Staff can clearly articulate their security decision-making authority without hesitation

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] **Incident response playbooks** (last 3 used)
- [ ] **Decision authority matrix** or security roles document
- [ ] **Patch management logs** (last 6 months)
- [ ] **Security incident tickets** (last 3 months - timing data)
- [ ] **Emergency contact/escalation procedures**

### Demonstrations to Request:
- [ ] **"Show me your last critical patch decision"** - walk through actual timeline
- [ ] **"Who would you call for a security incident at 2 AM?"** - test authority knowledge
- [ ] **"Walk me through your most recent security alert"** - decision process

### System Checks:
- [ ] **Patch deployment timeline** in ticketing system
- [ ] **Incident response time stamps** in SIEM/logging
- [ ] **Approval workflows** in change management system

### Interview Targets:
- [ ] **Security team lead** (decision authority understanding)
- [ ] **IT manager** (escalation patterns)
- [ ] **Help desk staff** (after-hours procedures)
- [ ] **1-2 general employees** (security decision confidence)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**START:** Count YES answers from Quick Assessment

**7 YES answers** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)**
- AND critical patches deployed <72 hours
- AND incidents contained <1 hour

**5-6 YES answers** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**
- OR critical patches take 3-7 days
- OR incidents take 1-4 hours to contain

**<5 YES answers** ‚Üí **RED (2)**
- OR critical patches take >7 days
- OR incidents take >4 hours to contain
- OR no emergency procedures exist

### Override Conditions:
- **Automatic RED** if: No documented time limits exist
- **Automatic RED** if: Staff cannot articulate decision authority
- **Automatic RED** if: >3 security decisions delayed >1 week in past 6 months

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
- **"Walk me through your last critical security patch - from identification to deployment."**
- **"Who has authority to shut down a server during a suspected breach?"**
- **"What happens when your security team disagrees on the response to a threat?"**

### Follow-up Prompts:
- **If delays mentioned:** "What caused the delay - technical issues or approval process?"
- **If authority unclear:** "Who would make that decision if [person] was unavailable?"
- **If escalation frequent:** "How often do security decisions go to [senior level]?"

### Red Flag Indicators:
- **Multiple approval signatures** required for routine actions
- **"We always err on the side of caution"** (analysis paralysis language)
- **"Better safe than sorry"** regarding security decisions
- **Staff expressing fear** of making wrong security choices
- **Delays blamed on "due diligence"** without time constraints

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:
- **Instead of "paralysis":** "decision optimization opportunities"
- **Instead of "fear-based":** "confidence-building areas"
- **Instead of "delays":** "process efficiency improvements"
