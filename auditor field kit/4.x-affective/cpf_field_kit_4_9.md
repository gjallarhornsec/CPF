## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree:**

**START:** Count YES answers from Quick Assessment

**7 YES answers** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)** - Low Vulnerability
- Formal protocols exist for all categories
- Continue to solution priorities

**4-6 YES answers** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)** - Moderate Vulnerability  
- Some protocols exist but gaps identified
- Continue to solution priorities

**0-3 YES answers** ‚Üí **RED (2)** - High Vulnerability
- Minimal or no euphoria-specific protections
- Priority remediation required

### **Validation Questions:**
If scoring **YELLOW** or **GREEN**, verify:
- [ ] Has organization had major success/celebration in last 12 months?
- [ ] Were security protocols actually followed during that event?
- [ ] Any security incidents within 1 week of major celebrations?

**If any validation fails** ‚Üí **Move score UP one level** (Green‚ÜíYellow, Yellow‚ÜíRed)

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions:**
- *"Tell me about your most recent major company celebration or success. How did you handle security during that time?"*
- *"When your team gets exciting news‚Äîlike a big deal or award‚Äîwhat typically happens with your normal security procedures?"*

### **Follow-up Prompts:**
**If they mention celebrations:**
- *"Did anyone need special access to systems during the event?"*
- *"How did you handle employee social media activity during the celebration?"*
- *"Were any security procedures adjusted or temporarily changed?"*

**If they mention recent successes:**
- *"In the days right after that success, did your team make any quick decisions to capitalize on the momentum?"*
- *"Were your normal approval processes still followed during that exciting time?"*

### **Red Flag Indicators (Probe Deeper):**
- **Mentions of "we were so excited we..."**
- **Stories about "special circumstances" during events**  
- **Descriptions of "fast-tracking" decisions after successes**
- **Comments about employees "celebrating on social media"**
- **Any mention of temporary password sharing or access**

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:**
- Instead of: *"Your people get careless when happy"*
- Say: *"Success periods can create unique security considerations"*

- Instead of: *"Celebrations make you vulnerable"*  
- Say: *"High-positive events benefit from structured security protocols"*
