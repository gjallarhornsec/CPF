# CPF Auditor Field Kit

**Practical assessment tools for cybersecurity psychology vulnerabilities**

This repository contains the operational assessment tools for the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF). Each vulnerability domain includes three complementary components designed for different assessment needs and expertise levels.

## Assessment Components

### 📚 Foundation Documents (`*_foundation.md`)
**Target Audience**: Research teams, training developers, solution architects

Deep theoretical analysis providing the psychological and scientific basis for each vulnerability. These documents contain:
- Research citations and empirical evidence
- Detailed psychological mechanisms
- Historical attack analysis
- Neuroscience and behavioral insights
- Cultural and organizational context

**Use Cases**:
- Training program development
- Solution design justification
- Academic research and validation
- Stakeholder education materials

### 🔧 Operational Documents (`*_operational.md`)
**Target Audience**: Security professionals, consultants, risk managers

Comprehensive assessment protocols with detailed scoring methodology. These documents include:
- Structured interview questions with follow-up probes
- Technical verification procedures
- Evidence collection requirements
- Solution catalogs with ROI estimates
- Success metrics and monitoring approaches

**Use Cases**:
- Formal risk assessments
- Compliance evaluations
- Vendor security reviews
- Board-level reporting

### ⚡ Field Kit Documents (`*_field_kit.md`)
**Target Audience**: Auditors, penetration testers, rapid assessment teams

Streamlined 30-minute assessment tools for immediate vulnerability identification. These documents provide:
- 5-minute quick assessment checklists
- Evidence collection templates
- Rapid scoring decision trees
- Priority solution recommendations
- Client conversation scripts

**Use Cases**:
- Rapid security assessments
- Pre-engagement reconnaissance
- Incident response psychological profiling
- On-site audit support

## Assessment Workflow

### Standard Assessment Process
1. **Start with Field Kit** → Rapid vulnerability identification (30 min)
2. **Deep-dive with Operational** → Comprehensive analysis (2-4 hours)
3. **Reference Foundation** → Solution justification and training

### Rapid Assessment Process
1. **Field Kit Only** → Immediate risk scoring and priority actions (30 min)
2. **Operational Follow-up** → Detailed assessment of high-risk findings

## Scoring System

All assessments use the standardized CPF ternary scoring:

- **🟢 Green (0)**: Minimal vulnerability - monitoring recommended
- **🟡 Yellow (1)**: Moderate vulnerability - intervention planning required  
- **🔴 Red (2)**: Critical vulnerability - immediate action required

### Aggregate Scoring
- **Domain Score**: Sum of 10 indicators (0-20 range)
- **CPF Total**: Weighted sum across all domains
- **Risk Priority**: Highest individual indicator scores take precedence

## Privacy and Ethics

All assessment tools are designed with privacy-first principles:
- **No individual profiling** - aggregate behavioral pattern analysis only
- **Minimum viable data collection** - only security-relevant observations
- **Anonymized reporting** - role-based rather than person-specific findings
- **Consent-based** - clear communication about assessment scope and purpose

## Getting Started

### For Security Auditors
1. Review the Field Kit for your target domain (e.g., `1.x-authority/`)
2. Use the 30-minute rapid assessment protocol
3. Escalate to Operational assessment for Red/Yellow findings

### For Risk Managers  
1. Start with Operational assessment for comprehensive coverage
2. Reference Foundation documents for stakeholder communication
3. Use success metrics for ongoing monitoring

### For Researchers
1. Begin with Foundation documents for theoretical grounding
2. Reference Operational protocols for empirical validation
3. Contribute improvements through standard academic channels

**⚠️ Important**: These tools assess organizational psychological patterns, not individual psychology. Misuse for employee evaluation or discrimination is strictly prohibited and undermines the framework's scientific validity.

**🔬 Research Status**: CPF is actively being validated through pilot implementations. Assessment results should be considered alongside traditional security controls, not as replacements.
