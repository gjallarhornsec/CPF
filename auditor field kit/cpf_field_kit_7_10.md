## Recovery Period Vulnerabilities

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check all that apply - Observable evidence only:**

‚ñ° **Q1:** Organization has documented recovery protocol lasting 72+ hours post-incident
‚ñ° **Q2:** Fresh security personnel (not incident responders) monitor during recovery periods  
‚ñ° **Q3:** Security controls remain unchanged during 72-hour recovery window
‚ñ° **Q4:** External validation required before declaring incident "fully resolved"
‚ñ° **Q5:** Formal staff rotation policy exists for incident response teams
‚ñ° **Q6:** Recovery timeline decisions based on security criteria (not business pressure)
‚ñ° **Q7:** No security exceptions permitted during recovery periods

**Checkbox Count:** ___/7

---

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### **Documents to Request:**
‚ñ° Most recent incident response report and recovery timeline
‚ñ° Security monitoring procedures for post-incident periods
‚ñ° Staff rotation/fatigue management policies
‚ñ° Access request logs from last recovery period
‚ñ° Recovery phase communication protocols
‚ñ° Security exception approval logs (last 6 months)

### **System Demonstrations:**
‚ñ° **"Show me how you declare an incident resolved"** - Who decides? What criteria?
‚ñ° **"Walk through your last recovery period"** - Timeline from resolution to normal ops
‚ñ° **"Show me who monitors security during recovery"** - Same team or different personnel?

### **Interview Targets:**
‚ñ° **CISO/Security Manager:** Recovery protocols and decision authority
‚ñ° **Incident Response Lead:** Staff rotation and fatigue management
‚ñ° **Operations Manager:** Business pressure vs. security timeline conflicts
‚ñ° **SOC Analyst:** Alert handling during recent recovery periods

### **System Checks:**
‚ñ° Review security alert sensitivity settings during last recovery
‚ñ° Check access control logs 48-72 hours post last major incident  
‚ñ° Verify external security consultant engagement records
‚ñ° Examine recovery phase security audit results

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree:**

**Start Here:** Count checked boxes from Quick Assessment

**If 6-7 boxes checked:**
- **AND** external validation documented **‚Üí GREEN (0)**
- **AND** no external validation **‚Üí YELLOW (1)**

**If 3-5 boxes checked:**
- **AND** formal recovery protocol exists **‚Üí YELLOW (1)** 
- **AND** no formal recovery protocol **‚Üí RED (2)**

**If 0-2 boxes checked:**
- **‚Üí RED (2)** (High Recovery Vulnerability)

**Final Score:** ___/2

### **Red Flags (Immediate RED regardless of checklist):**
‚ñ° Same incident team monitors recovery periods
‚ñ° Security exceptions routinely approved during recovery
‚ñ° "All clear" declared same day as technical resolution
‚ñ° No recovery period security monitoring

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### **HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION**
‚ñ° **72-Hour Recovery Protocol** (Cost: Low, Time: 2-4 weeks)
  - Define security checkpoints at 24/48/72 hours
  - Create recovery validation criteria checklist

‚ñ° **Fresh Eyes Monitoring** (Cost: Medium, Time: 1-2 weeks)  
  - Assign non-incident personnel to recovery monitoring
  - Rotate security teams after 48 hours

### **HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM**
‚ñ° **External Recovery Validation** (Cost: High, Time: 2-3 months)
  - Contract third-party security consultant
  - Require external sign-off before "all clear"
  - Dependencies: Budget approval, vendor selection

‚ñ° **Automated Recovery Controls** (Cost: High, Time: 3-6 months)
  - Prevent security relaxation during recovery periods
  - Dependencies: Security system integration

### **MEDIUM IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION**  
‚ñ° **Recovery Communication Protocol** (Cost: Low, Time: 1-2 weeks)
  - Avoid premature "all clear" messaging
  - Train leadership on recovery communications

‚ñ° **Staff Rotation Policy** (Cost: Low, Time: 2-3 weeks)
  - Mandatory rest for incident responders
  - Fresh personnel for recovery monitoring

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions:**
- *"Walk me through what happens in the 72 hours after you resolve a major security incident."*
- *"Who makes the decision that an incident is completely over?"*
- *"How do you prevent your team from letting their guard down after successfully handling an attack?"*

### **Follow-Up Prompts:**
**If they mention business pressure:**
- *"Can you give me a specific example of when business needs conflicted with security timeline?"*

**If they mention team fatigue:**  
- *"How do you handle security monitoring when your incident response team is exhausted?"*

**If they claim no recovery vulnerabilities:**
- *"What security checks do you perform before declaring 'all clear'?"*

### **Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation:**
‚ñ° **Defensive responses** about recovery speed
‚ñ° **Vague answers** about who monitors during recovery  
‚ñ° **Examples of rushing** back to normal operations
‚ñ° **No awareness** of recovery period risks
‚ñ° **Business pressure** overriding security decisions

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:**
- **Instead of:** "Your recovery process is vulnerable"
- **Say:** "Let's explore opportunities to strengthen your post-incident security posture"

- **Instead of:** "Your team gets careless after incidents"  
- **Say:** "Industry research shows recovery periods present unique security considerations"
