## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each item observed or confirmed:**

‚ñ° **Written verification procedures exist** for unusual requests from executives/IT staff  
‚ñ° **Multi-channel verification required** (e.g., email request ‚Üí phone callback)  
‚ñ° **Authority impersonation training provided** in past 12 months  
‚ñ° **Executive exception policies documented** with approval workflows  
‚ñ° **Emergency bypass procedures require authentication** of authority figures

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here** ‚Üí Are written verification procedures in place?

**NO** ‚Üí **RED (2)** - High Vulnerability
- No formal procedures = automatic high risk
- Skip to Solution Priority Matrix

**YES** ‚Üí Are procedures consistently followed?

**Check recent examples:**
- **All examples show verification** ‚Üí Continue assessment
- **Mixed or no verification examples** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)** - Moderate Vulnerability
- **No recent examples available** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)** - Moderate Vulnerability

**Consistent verification confirmed** ‚Üí Check training and culture:
- **Authority impersonation training + employee comfort questioning** ‚Üí **GREEN (0)** - Low Vulnerability
- **Basic training only OR employee discomfort** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)** - Moderate Vulnerability
- **No specific training** ‚Üí **RED (2)** - High Vulnerability

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM IMPLEMENTATION (Do Second)
- **Authority Authentication System** (Cost: Medium, Time: 4-6 weeks)
  - Verified contact database for executives
  - Secure communication channels with MFA

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG IMPLEMENTATION (Do Third)
- **Psychological Safety Programs** (Cost: Medium, Time: 3-6 months)
  - Cultural change to encourage verification
  - Leadership modeling of verification acceptance

### ONGOING / CULTURAL (Continuous)
- **Authority Impersonation Training** (Cost: Low, Time: Quarterly)
  - Role-playing simulations with verification practice
  - Respectful verification scripts and procedures

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about the last time someone received an unusual request from leadership..."**

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "What happened next?"
- "Was the request verified? How?"
- "Would a junior employee feel comfortable questioning this?"

### Red Flag Indicators
- **"We trust our executives"** (no verification culture)
- **"Emergencies require fast action"** (bypass procedures)
- **"People know not to question leadership"** (cultural resistance)
- **"IT handles their own verification"** (unclear authority chains)

### Sensitivity Topics (Use Carefully)
**"Has anyone ever reported a suspicious request from apparent leadership?"**
- If YES: "What was the response?"
- If NO: "Would they feel safe doing so?"

**"During your last security incident, who took charge and how was their authority verified?"**
- Look for crisis authority verification gaps
