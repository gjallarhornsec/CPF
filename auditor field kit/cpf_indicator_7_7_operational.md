# CPF INDICATOR 7.7: Stress-induced Tunnel Vision

## CONTEXT

Stress-induced tunnel vision occurs when high-pressure situations cause security teams to focus narrowly on immediate threats while missing broader attack patterns or critical security indicators. This psychological response narrows cognitive processing and reduces working memory, making organizations vulnerable to sophisticated multi-vector attacks and complex threats that require comprehensive analysis. Organizations with high-stress environments systematically miss security incidents that fall outside their immediate focus area.

## ASSESSMENT

**Question 1: Crisis Response Time Allocation**
During your last major security incident, what percentage of the response team's time was spent on comprehensive threat hunting versus addressing the most obvious symptoms? Tell us your specific example of how time was allocated during the incident.

**Question 2: Alert Investigation Depth**
When your security team receives multiple high-priority alerts simultaneously, what is your standard procedure for ensuring all alerts receive thorough investigation? Give us a recent example where you had 5+ critical alerts within a 2-hour window.

**Question 3: Cross-Team Communication Under Pressure**
How often do your security analysts consult with other teams (network, application, compliance) when investigating complex security events during high-stress periods? Tell us about a recent incident where this consultation did or didn't happen.

**Question 4: Incident Response Scope Assessment**
What's your documented process for determining whether a security incident might be part of a larger, coordinated attack rather than an isolated event? Give us an example of how this process worked in your most recent significant incident.

**Question 5: Decision Validation Under Time Pressure**
When facing urgent security decisions (like system shutdown, access revocation, or emergency patches), what's your process for double-checking these decisions before implementation? Tell us about a time when this validation process prevented or caused problems.

**Question 6: Resource Allocation During Crisis**
How does your organization ensure that routine security monitoring continues when the team is focused on active incident response? Give us a specific example from the last 6 months.

**Question 7: Post-Incident Comprehensive Review**
After resolving security incidents, how often do you discover additional attack vectors or indicators that were initially missed during the response? Tell us about your most recent example where you found something significant post-incident.

## SCORING

- No decision validation process or easily bypassed validation
- Routine monitoring completely stops during active incident response
- Post-incident discoveries occur in >40% of resolved cases

## RISK SCENARIOS

**Multi-Vector Distraction Attacks**: Attackers launch obvious, noisy attacks (like DDoS or defacements) to trigger tunnel vision, then execute their primary objective (data exfiltration, lateral movement) while security teams focus exclusively on the distraction. The Target breach exemplifies this - overwhelming alerts caused teams to miss sophisticated APT indicators.

**Crisis Amplification Exploitation**: During natural business crises (earnings releases, regulatory audits, system migrations), attackers exploit organizational stress by launching attacks knowing that tunnel vision will prevent comprehensive threat assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic saw widespread exploitation of this pattern.

**Authority-Based Social Engineering**: Attackers impersonate executives during high-stress periods when employees are already under pressure, exploiting tunnel vision to bypass normal verification procedures. CEO fraud attacks increase 300% during quarterly reporting periods when organizational stress peaks.

**Complex Attack Staging**: Sophisticated attackers use initial compromise to create ongoing low-level stress through system instability or performance issues, then exploit the resulting tunnel vision to execute advanced persistent threat activities while security teams remain focused on system reliability rather than security indicators.

## SOLUTION CATALOG

**Solution 1: Incident Response Decision Trees**
Implement mandatory decision trees for all security incidents that force consideration of multiple attack vectors before proceeding. Include specific checkpoints: "Have you checked for lateral movement?" "Have you verified this isn't a distraction attack?" "What systems weren't affected?" Document completion of all checkpoints before incident closure.

**Solution 2: Parallel Investigation Teams**
Establish minimum staffing requirements that ensure routine security monitoring continues during incident response. Create formal "business as usual" teams that cannot be reassigned to incident response without executive approval. Implement rotating incident response assignments to prevent team exhaustion.

**Solution 3: Stress Circuit Breakers**
Implement mandatory pause protocols when incident response exceeds defined stress thresholds (multiple critical alerts, response time >4 hours, executive escalation). Require 15-minute team huddles every 2 hours during extended incidents to reassess scope and approach. Include external perspective requirement for incidents lasting >8 hours.

**Solution 4: Cross-Functional Review Panels**
Establish mandatory consultation requirements with network, application, and compliance teams for all "critical" or "high" severity incidents. Create standardized consultation templates with specific questions each team must answer. Implement escalation triggers when consultation reveals conflicting information.

**Solution 5: Automated Scope Assessment Tools**
Deploy security orchestration tools that automatically correlate incidents across time windows, attack vectors, and affected systems. Configure alerts for potential multi-vector attacks based on statistical patterns. Require security analysts to review automated scope assessment before declaring incidents "contained."

**Solution 6: Post-Incident Red Team Reviews**
Conduct structured red team reviews within 48 hours of incident resolution specifically looking for missed indicators and alternative attack vectors. Include external security consultants in reviews for critical incidents. Maintain database of "missed indicators" to identify tunnel vision patterns and training needs.

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**Decision Trees Implementation**:
- Request sample completed decision trees from recent incidents
- Verify all checkpoints have documented responses, not just checkmarks
- Interview incident responders about decision tree utility and compliance
- Check for incidents closed without completed decision trees

**Parallel Investigation Verification**:
- Review staffing schedules during last 3 major incidents
- Confirm routine monitoring logs continued during incident response
- Interview "business as usual" team members about workload during crises
- Verify executive approval required for reassignment

**Stress Circuit Breakers Evidence**:
- Request documentation of pause protocols triggered in recent incidents
- Interview team leads about huddle frequency and effectiveness
- Verify external perspective involvement in extended incidents
- Check for incidents where circuit breakers were bypassed

**Cross-Functional Consultation Records**:
- Review consultation templates completed for recent critical incidents
- Interview network/application/compliance teams about consultation quality
- Verify escalation triggers activated when conflicting information emerged
- Check for incidents where required consultation was skipped

**Automated Tool Configuration**:
- Review tool configuration for multi-vector correlation rules
- Test alert generation for simulated multi-vector scenarios
- Verify analyst workflow requires scope assessment review
- Check for false positive/negative rates in scope assessments

**Red Team Review Documentation**:
- Request red team review reports for recent critical incidents
