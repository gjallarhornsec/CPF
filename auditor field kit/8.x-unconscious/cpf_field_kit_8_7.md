# 📋 CPF INDICATOR 8.7 FIELD KIT
**Symbolic Equation Confusion Assessment**

---

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observation:**

□ **Q1:** Do users typically click security alerts within 10 seconds without reading content?
□ **Q2:** Does security training focus on "recognizing trusted symbols" rather than verification steps?
□ **Q3:** Are users unable to explain how to verify an SSL certificate beyond "look for the padlock"?
□ **Q4:** Do incident reports show users installing software based on security-themed popups?
□ **Q5:** Is there no written policy requiring IT contact before acting on unfamiliar security warnings?
□ **Q6:** Do users report "it looked legitimate" as primary reason for security decisions in incidents?
□ **Q7:** Are there more than 2 security-related malware infections per month despite security awareness training?

**RED FLAG COUNT:** ___/7

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Security incident reports** from last 90 days (focus on malware/phishing)
- [ ] **Security awareness training materials** (look for symbol recognition vs. verification)
- [ ] **IT help desk tickets** related to "suspicious popups" or "security warnings"
- [ ] **Written security policies** for user response to unfamiliar alerts
- [ ] **Screenshots of endpoint protection configuration**

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] **"Show me how you verify a website is secure"** (watch for padlock-only approach)
- [ ] **"Walk through your response to a security popup"** (time the decision process)
- [ ] **"Show me your approved security software list"** (check if it exists)

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Group policy settings** - verify prevention of unauthorized security software installation
- [ ] **Email security rules** - check for flagging external security-themed messages
- [ ] **Alert system configuration** - document all sources of security notifications

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **End users** (2-3 random staff members)
- [ ] **IT help desk personnel** 
- [ ] **Security awareness trainer**
- [ ] **IT administrator** responsible for endpoint protection

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree
**RED (2 points):**
- If 5+ Quick Assessment questions = YES
- OR if >3 security malware infections in 90 days
- OR if users cannot explain verification steps beyond visual recognition

**YELLOW (1 point):**
- If 3-4 Quick Assessment questions = YES
- AND some verification procedures exist but inconsistently followed
- AND 1-3 security malware infections in 90 days

**GREEN (0 points):**
- If ≤2 Quick Assessment questions = YES
- AND documented verification procedures exist and are followed
- AND <1 security malware infection in 90 days
- AND training includes hands-on verification exercises

**FINAL SCORE:** _____ (0=Green, 1=Yellow, 2=Red)

## 🔧 SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION (Do First)
- [ ] **Block unauthorized security popups** via group policy (Cost: Low, Time: 1 day)
- [ ] **Create security alert verification checklist** (Cost: Low, Time: 2 days)
- [ ] **Establish IT-only security software installation policy** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM (Plan Next)
- [ ] **Deploy centralized security notification system** (Cost: Medium, Time: 4-6 weeks)
- [ ] **Implement hands-on verification training workshops** (Cost: Medium, Time: 8 weeks)
- [ ] **Create security decision audit trail system** (Cost: High, Time: 12 weeks)

### MEDIUM IMPACT / ONGOING
- [ ] **Regular phishing simulations with fake security notifications** (Cost: Low, Ongoing)
- [ ] **Security symbol awareness in monthly training** (Cost: Low, Ongoing)
- [ ] **Monitor help desk tickets for verification pattern trends** (Cost: Low, Ongoing)

**DEPENDENCIES:**
- Group policy changes require domain admin access
- Training workshops need management approval for staff time
- Centralized notifications need IT infrastructure assessment

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"When your users see a security warning popup, what typically happens next?"**
- *Follow-up: "How quickly do they usually respond?"*
- *Listen for: Immediate clicking vs. verification steps*

**"Can you walk me through your last security incident involving a user clicking something they shouldn't have?"**
- *Follow-up: "What was their explanation for clicking it?"*
- *Red flag: "It looked legitimate" or "I trusted the antivirus logo"*

**"How do you train users to tell the difference between real and fake security alerts?"**
- *Follow-up: "Can you show me the training materials?"*
- *Red flag: Focus on symbol recognition rather than verification steps*

### Probing Questions for Red Flags
**If users mention visual cues:** "Besides the appearance, what other checks do they perform?"

**If training exists:** "How do users practice these verification skills?"

**If incidents occurred:** "What patterns do you see in why users trust fake security messages?"

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of:** "Your users are falling for obvious fakes"
- **Say:** "We're seeing a pattern where visual security indicators may be driving decisions"

- **Instead of:** "This is a basic security failure"
- **Say:** "There's an opportunity to strengthen verification procedures"
