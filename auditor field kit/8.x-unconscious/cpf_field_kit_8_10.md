## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each question:**

‚ñ° **Q1:** Does organization require multi-channel verification (phone + email/text + in-person) for unusual digital requests over $1000 or system access changes?
   - YES = Documented procedure exists and is enforced
   - NO = Single-channel approval allowed or no procedure

‚ñ° **Q2:** Has organization provided digital deception training (deepfakes, AI manipulation) within past 90 days?
   - YES = Documented training with recent examples
   - NO = No training or outdated (>90 days)

‚ñ° **Q3:** Are business and personal digital activities technically separated on company devices?
   - YES = Separate profiles/networks prevent mixed usage
   - NO = Same systems used for business and entertainment

‚ñ° **Q4:** Do virtual meetings require participant identity verification for sensitive discussions?
   - YES = Authentication dashboard or similar verification system
   - NO = No identity verification beyond meeting invite

‚ñ° **Q5:** Are employee interactions with AI systems/chatbots logged and monitored?
   - YES = Automated monitoring with alert systems
   - NO = No monitoring or logging of AI interactions

‚ñ° **Q6:** Do employees report suspicious digital content through established workflow?
   - YES = One-click reporting system with documented responses
   - NO = No reporting system or unclear process

‚ñ° **Q7:** Have there been zero authentication bypasses due to "digital urgency" in past 90 days?
   - YES = System logs show no bypasses
   - NO = Any documented bypasses or incidents

**Quick Score:** Count YES answers ‚Üí **Green: 6-7** | **Yellow: 3-5** | **Red: 0-2**

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] Multi-channel verification procedures (written policy)
- [ ] Digital deception training materials and attendance records
- [ ] Virtual meeting security protocols
- [ ] AI interaction policies and monitoring logs
- [ ] Incident reports from past 90 days (authentication bypasses)
- [ ] System configuration documentation (business/personal separation)

### Demonstrations Needed
- [ ] "Show me how you handle an urgent wire transfer request via email"
- [ ] "Demonstrate your virtual meeting authentication process"
- [ ] "Walk through reporting suspicious digital content"
- [ ] "Show me AI chatbot interaction guidelines"

### System Checks to Perform

**NO** ‚Üí **RED (2)**

**YES** ‚Üí Is verification consistently enforced with system controls?

**NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

**YES** ‚Üí Has organization provided digital deception training in past 90 days?

**NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

**YES** ‚Üí Are business/entertainment digital activities technically separated?

**NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

**YES** ‚Üí Zero authentication bypasses in past 90 days?

**NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW (1)**

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"How does your team currently handle urgent digital requests like wire transfers or password resets?"**

*Follow-up if unclear:* "Walk me through what happens when someone gets an urgent email from the CEO requesting a wire transfer."

**"Tell me about the last time an employee questioned whether a digital communication was authentic."**

*Follow-up if no examples:* "What would happen if someone received a suspicious video call claiming to be from management?"

**"How do employees distinguish between business and personal activities on company devices?"**

*Follow-up for specifics:* "Can someone play games or use social media on the same system they use for sensitive business data?"

### Red Flag Indicators
- **Immediate concern:** "We trust our employees to use good judgment"
- **High risk:** "Our CEO doesn't like extra verification steps"
- **Critical:** "We've had a few incidents but learned from them"
- **Urgent:** "Our employees bypass security when it's really urgent"

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of "dream logic":** "fantasy-based thinking in digital environments"
- **Instead of "psychological vulnerability":** "human factors in digital security"
- **Instead of "unconscious processes":** "automatic responses to digital stimuli"
