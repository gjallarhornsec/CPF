## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions**

‚ñ° **"How does your team typically respond to external security recommendations?"**  
   *Follow-up*: "Can you give me a specific recent example?"

‚ñ° **"What types of security threats get the most attention in team discussions?"**  
   *Follow-up*: "How do you ensure balanced coverage of different threat types?"

### **Red Flag Indicators** 
‚ñ° Defensive language about current security approaches  
‚ñ° Dismissive comments about "simple" or "unsophisticated" attacks
