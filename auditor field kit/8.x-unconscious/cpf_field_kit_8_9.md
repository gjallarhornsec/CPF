# CPF FIELD KIT 8.9: COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS PATTERNS

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization has documented "emergency security procedures" that differ from normal protocols
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security incidents cluster around specific calendar dates (holidays, fiscal periods, company events)  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security decisions during incidents require group consensus or executive approval
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Employees regularly bypass authentication "to help teammates" during busy periods
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security priorities focus on threats with high media visibility rather than statistical likelihood
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Protocol violations increase during organizational changes (mergers, layoffs, leadership transitions)
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Incident response uses language like "heroes," "battles," "enemies," or "saving the company"

**Quick Score**: 0-2 YES = Green | 3-5 YES = Yellow | 6-7 YES = Red

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Crisis response procedures** (last 12 months)
- [ ] **Security incident logs** (by date for pattern analysis)  
- [ ] **Emergency access approval records**
- [ ] **Security awareness training materials**
- [ ] **Incident response post-mortems** (most recent 3)

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] "Show me how you handle security during company emergencies"
- [ ] "Walk me through your last major security incident response"
- [ ] "Demonstrate emergency access request process"

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] Review authentication bypass logs for frequency patterns
- [ ] Check security monitoring alerts for date clustering
- [ ] Verify individual vs. group approval requirements in access systems

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **Security Team Lead**: Decision-making process during incidents
- [ ] **IT Manager**: Emergency procedure usage frequency  
- [ ] **Department Head**: Team behavior during organizational stress
- [ ] **Recent New Hire**: Observed team security behaviors

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree
```
START: Count YES answers from Quick Assessment

0-2 YES answers?
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GREEN: Protocols maintained during stress

3-5 YES answers?  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check incident clustering: 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clear date patterns? ‚Üí RED
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No clear patterns? ‚Üí YELLOW

6-7 YES answers?
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RED: Frequent protocol abandonment
```

### Objective Thresholds
- **Green**: <10% protocol deviation during stress events
- **Yellow**: 10-30% protocol deviation OR some incident clustering
- **Red**: >30% protocol deviation AND clear incident clustering patterns

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Stress-tested security checklists** (Cost: Low, Timeline: 2 weeks)
  - Create simplified "crisis mode" procedures
  - Test during planned stress scenarios

- **Individual decision authority framework** (Cost: Medium, Timeline: 1 month)
  - Assign specific security decisions to individuals
  - Remove group override capabilities

### MEDIUM IMPACT / LONG-TERM
- **Cultural calendar risk management** (Cost: Medium, Timeline: 3 months)
  - Map historical incident patterns to calendar events
  - Implement automated monitoring during high-risk periods

- **Bypass detection systems** (Cost: High, Timeline: 6 months)
  - Deploy technical monitoring for simultaneous protocol deviations
  - Create alerts for unusual access patterns

### FOUNDATIONAL / ONGOING
- **Counter-cultural security training** (Cost: Medium, Timeline: Ongoing)
  - Address collective behavior patterns in awareness programs
  - Train recognition of stress-period vulnerabilities

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Tell me about your last organizational emergency - how did security procedures work?"**

*Follow-up if vague*: "Specifically, what security steps were skipped or modified?"

**"Looking at your calendar, when do you typically see more security issues?"**

*Follow-up*: "Can you give me specific examples from [mention identified pattern period]?"

**"When a security incident happens, who makes the final decisions?"**

*Follow-up*: "Has executive pressure ever overridden security team recommendations?"

### Red Flag Indicators Requiring Deeper Investigation
- Mentions of "heroic" responses to security incidents
- Consistent blaming of external attackers without internal reflection  
- Reluctance to discuss incidents during specific time periods
- References to security decisions being "group efforts"
- Descriptions of security as "battles" or "wars"

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- Instead of: "Your team has psychological vulnerabilities"
- Say: "We've identified patterns where security protocols change during organizational stress"

- Instead of: "You're projecting blame onto attackers"  
- Say: "Let's examine both internal and external factors in these incidents"
