# üìã INDICATOR 8.8 FIELD KIT: ARCHETYPAL ACTIVATION TRIGGERS

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable condition:**

‚ñ° **Emergency Override Frequency**: Does the organization have >3 documented security overrides per month labeled as "emergency" or "urgent"?

‚ñ° **Authority Exception Process**: Can senior executives or external authorities bypass security procedures without documented two-person verification?

‚ñ° **Hero Narrative Incidents**: Are there documented cases in the last 6 months where employees circumvented security "to help" or "save the day"?

‚ñ° **Clever Solution Tolerance**: Does the organization have examples of security policy violations being overlooked because the solution was "creative" or "innovative"?

‚ñ° **Trust-Based Decisions**: Do employees regularly skip verification steps when someone presents as "trustworthy," "helpful," or "just solving a simple problem"?

‚ñ° **Language Pattern Presence**: Do security incident reports contain words like "emergency," "authorized by," "help save," "clever solution," or "trust me" in >30% of cases?

‚ñ° **Verification Pause Absence**: Is there NO mandatory pause/verification step for requests using emotional urgency language?

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### **Decision Tree**

**START HERE**: Are formal verification procedures consistently followed regardless of emotional appeals?

‚Üí **YES** ‚Üí Are there <3 emergency overrides per month with full documentation?
   ‚Üí **YES** = **GREEN (0)**
   ‚Üí **NO** = **YELLOW (1)**

‚Üí **NO** ‚Üí Do authority figures regularly bypass security through status alone?
   ‚Üí **YES** = **RED (2)**
   ‚Üí **NO** = **YELLOW (1)**

### **Objective Scoring Criteria**

| Score | Emergency Overrides/Month | Authority Bypass | Hero Incidents | Language Patterns |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **GREEN (0)** | <3 with full documentation | Never without verification | None rewarded | <10% of incidents |
| **YELLOW (1)** | 3-10 with some documentation | Monthly but eventually verified | Sometimes overlooked | 10-30% of incidents |
| **RED (2)** | >10 or minimal documentation | Weekly without verification | Regularly celebrated | >30% of incidents |

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions**
- "Can you walk me through what happens when someone calls claiming to be your CEO and needs immediate access to something?"
- "Tell me about the last time someone in your organization 'saved the day' by working around a security procedure."
- "How do your employees typically respond when someone seems really helpful and trustworthy?"

### **Follow-up Prompts**
- **If they mention exceptions**: "How often does this happen? What verification steps are required?"
- **If they mention heroes**: "Was this person recognized? How did management respond?"
- **If they seem defensive**: "This is very common - we're looking for ways to help employees make good decisions under pressure."

### **Red Flag Indicators**
- **Immediate concern**: Authority figures can bypass security "because they're executives"
- **Deep investigation needed**: Multiple recent incidents with similar emotional language patterns
- **Cultural issue**: Pride in rule-breaking when framed as helpful/clever/heroic

### **Professional Language for Sensitive Topics**
- Instead of "psychological manipulation" ‚Üí "emotional pressure situations"
- Instead of "archetypal triggers" ‚Üí "common response patterns"  
- Instead of "unconscious responses" ‚Üí "natural human reactions"
- Instead of "vulnerability" ‚Üí "opportunity for improvement"
