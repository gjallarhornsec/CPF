# üìã CPF FIELD KIT 8.1: Shadow Projection onto Attackers

**Assessment Time: 22 minutes total**  
**Vulnerability**: Organizations focus exclusively on external threats while ignoring insider risks

---

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check all that apply - Look for 4+ checks for RED risk:**

‚ñ° **Budget Imbalance**: Less than 20% of cybersecurity budget allocated to insider threat detection  
‚ñ° **Investigation Delays**: Internal threat alerts take 2+ times longer to investigate than external alerts  
‚ñ° **Access Reviews**: Employee access rights reviewed annually or less frequently  
‚ñ° **Vendor Oversight**: No formal security monitoring of vendor/partner system access  
‚ñ° **Training Focus**: Less than 25% of security training addresses insider threats or social engineering  
‚ñ° **Incident Attribution**: Last 3 security incidents blamed primarily on "sophisticated external attackers"  
‚ñ° **Threat Intelligence**: No dedicated sources for insider threat or supply chain risk intelligence

**Quick Score**: 0-2 checks = GREEN | 3-4 checks = YELLOW | 5+ checks = RED

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
‚ñ° **Current cybersecurity budget breakdown** (last 12 months)  
‚ñ° **Most recent 3 security incident reports**  
‚ñ° **Employee access review logs** (last 6 months)  
‚ñ° **Security training curriculum and completion records**  
‚ñ° **Vendor security assessment checklist/process**  
‚ñ° **Security monitoring tool configuration summary**

### Demonstrations to Request:
‚ñ° **"Show me your security alert dashboard and typical response process"**  
‚ñ° **"Walk me through how you investigate a suspicious employee access alert"**  
‚ñ° **"Demonstrate your privileged access management system"**  
‚ñ° **"Show me your vendor access monitoring capabilities"**

### System Checks:
‚ñ° **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) alert categories**  
‚ñ° **User Behavior Analytics (UBA) tool presence and configuration**  
‚ñ° **Privileged Access Management (PAM) system implementation**  
‚ñ° **Insider threat detection capabilities**

### Interview Targets:
‚ñ° **CISO or Security Director**  
‚ñ° **SOC Manager or Lead Analyst**  
‚ñ° **IT Administrator with privileged access**  
‚ñ° **HR representative (background check process)**

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree:

**START HERE** ‚Üí Is insider threat budget ‚â•25% of total security budget?  
‚îú‚îÄ **YES** ‚Üí Are access reviews conducted quarterly with documented findings?  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ **YES** ‚Üí **GREEN** (Balanced approach)  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ **NO** ‚Üí **YELLOW** (Good investment, weak processes)  
‚îî‚îÄ **NO** ‚Üí Do internal alerts get same priority as external alerts?  
    ‚îú‚îÄ **YES** ‚Üí **YELLOW** (Good response, weak investment)  
    ‚îî‚îÄ **NO** ‚Üí **RED** (Heavy external focus)

### Objective Thresholds:
- **GREEN**: ‚â•25% insider threat budget + quarterly access reviews + equal alert priority  
- **YELLOW**: 15-24% insider threat budget OR semi-annual access reviews OR some alert delays  
- **RED**: <15% insider threat budget AND annual/ad-hoc access reviews AND significant alert delays

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"When you think about cybersecurity threats, what comes to mind first?"**  
*Listen for: External hackers, nation-states, criminals vs. insider mentions*

**"Tell me about your last security incident. What happened and how did you investigate it?"**  
*Listen for: External attribution, internal factor consideration, investigation thoroughness*

**"How do you monitor what your employees and contractors are doing with their system access?"**  
*Listen for: Specific tools, processes, frequency, examples*

### Follow-up Prompts:
- *If they mention only external threats*: **"What about risks from employees or trusted partners?"**  
- *If they lack insider monitoring*: **"How would you detect if an employee was accessing unusual data?"**  
- *If they have vendor access*: **"How do you monitor what your vendors are doing in your systems?"**

### Red Flag Indicators:
‚ñ° **Exclusive external focus** ("Our biggest threat is hackers/nation-states")  
‚ñ° **Employee idealization** ("We trust our people completely")  
‚ñ° **Vendor blind spots** ("Our partners are extensions of our team")  
‚ñ° **Incident externalization** ("It was a sophisticated attack, nothing we could do")  
‚ñ° **Monitoring gaps** ("We don't monitor internal activity - that would be Big Brother")
