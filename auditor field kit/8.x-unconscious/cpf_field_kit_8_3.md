# üìã INDICATOR 8.3 FIELD KIT
## Repetition Compulsion Patterns

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 min)

**Check YES/NO for each observable condition:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization has experienced 3+ security incidents with similar root causes in past 3 years
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Post-incident recommendations remain unimplemented before next similar incident occurs  
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security incidents cluster around anniversary dates of past major events
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization repeatedly selects vendors/tools with characteristics similar to past problematic choices
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Crisis communication reverts to same patterns that failed previously
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Security budget allocation mirrors past decisions that created vulnerabilities
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: No systematic process exists to check current decisions against past failure patterns

**Quick Score**: 4+ YES answers = RED | 2-3 YES = YELLOW | 0-1 YES = GREEN

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 min)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] **Incident reports** from past 3 years (focus on root cause analysis)
- [ ] **Post-incident action plans** and implementation status
- [ ] **Vendor selection documentation** from past 2 years
- [ ] **Security budget allocation** decisions and justifications
- [ ] **Crisis communication logs** from recent security events

### Demonstrations to Observe
- [ ] **"Show me your incident review process"** - watch actual procedure
- [ ] **"Walk through your vendor selection criteria"** - observe decision framework
- [ ] **"Demonstrate crisis communication protocol"** - see actual communication channels

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] **Incident database search** for pattern analysis capabilities
- [ ] **Security tool inventory** compared against past failed tool selections
- [ ] **Alert systems** for anniversary date monitoring
- [ ] **Decision documentation** traceability to historical outcomes

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **CISO/Security Leader** (strategic patterns)
- [ ] **Incident Response Manager** (operational patterns)  
- [ ] **IT Procurement Lead** (vendor selection patterns)
- [ ] **Crisis Communications Lead** (communication patterns)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 min)

### Decision Tree Scoring

**Start Here:** Does organization have documented incident pattern analysis?

**NO** ‚Üí Check incident frequency:
- Same root cause 4+ times in 3 years = **RED**
- Same root cause 2-3 times in 3 years = **YELLOW** 
- Same root cause 0-1 times in 3 years = **GREEN**

**YES** ‚Üí Check implementation effectiveness:
- Patterns continue despite analysis = **RED**
- Some improvement but patterns persist = **YELLOW**
- Clear pattern breaking with measurable results = **GREEN**

### Anniversary Pattern Check
- **Incidents cluster within 30 days of past event anniversaries** = Add 1 level (GREEN‚ÜíYELLOW‚ÜíRED)
- **No anniversary correlation** = No change to base score

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 min)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Incident Pattern Dashboard** (Cost: Low, Time: 30 days)
  - Automated incident clustering analysis
  - Anniversary date alert system
- **Decision History Checklist** (Cost: Low, Time: 14 days)
  - Mandatory past-decision comparison for major choices
  - Simple template integration into existing processes

### MEDIUM IMPACT / MEDIUM IMPLEMENTATION  
- **Alternative Response Procedures** (Cost: Medium, Time: 60 days)
  - Dependency: Incident response team availability
  - Pre-developed "pattern-breaking" response options
- **Vendor Selection Controls** (Cost: Medium, Time: 45 days)
  - Historical vendor performance integration
  - Procurement process modification required

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM IMPLEMENTATION
- **Crisis Communication Circuit Breakers** (Cost: High, Time: 90 days)
  - Dependency: External facilitator contracts
  - Requires cultural change management
- **Comprehensive Pattern Analysis System** (Cost: High, Time: 120 days)
  - Dependency: Data integration across multiple systems
  - Advanced analytics platform deployment

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 min)

### Opening Questions
- **"Tell me about your most recent security incident. How similar was it to previous incidents you've experienced?"**
- **"When you implement recommendations from incident reviews, what typically prevents full implementation?"**

### Follow-Up Prompts
- **If they mention repeated issues:** "How many times has this type of incident occurred? What was different about your response each time?"
- **If they mention timing patterns:** "Have you noticed incidents happening around significant dates or anniversaries?"
- **If they mention vendor issues:** "How do you evaluate potential vendors against past vendor relationships that didn't work out?"

### Red Flag Indicators
- **Language patterns:** "We always handle it this way" / "This is how we've always done crisis response"
- **Dismissive responses:** "Those incidents were completely different" when patterns are obvious
- **Anniversary clustering:** Defensive reaction when asked about incident timing
- **Vendor loyalty:** "We trust this vendor" without reference to past performance patterns

### Professional Phrasing for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of:** "You keep making the same mistakes"
- **Say:** "Organizations often find certain incident patterns challenging to break"
- **Instead of:** "Your decision-making is flawed"  
- **Say:** "Many organizations benefit from decision-making processes that incorporate historical analysis"
