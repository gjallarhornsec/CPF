# üìã CPF INDICATOR 8.6 FIELD KIT: DEFENSE MECHANISM INTERFERENCE

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Binary Assessment - Check Yes/No for each:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Are 80%+ of security alerts actioned within 30 days?
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Does external assessment remediation happen on committed timelines?
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Has security budget remained stable during last 2 budget cycles?
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Do employee security reports receive formal investigation within 48 hours?
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Do post-incident analyses identify internal improvements (not just external blame)?
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Has organization implemented changes after peer security incidents?
‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Are security requirements integrated into operations (not bypassed for efficiency)?

**Quick Scoring**: 6-7 Yes = GREEN | 4-5 Yes = YELLOW | 0-3 Yes = RED

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request
- [ ] Last 6 months of security alert logs with resolution status
- [ ] Most recent external security assessment + remediation plan
- [ ] Budget allocation documents for last 2 years (security line items)
- [ ] Employee security incident reporting logs
- [ ] Last 3 post-incident analysis reports
- [ ] Security policy documents vs. actual implementation evidence

### Demonstrations to Request
- [ ] "Show me your security alert tracking system"
- [ ] "Walk through your last incident response process"
- [ ] "Demonstrate how employees report security concerns"
- [ ] "Show budget approval process for security investments"

### System Checks to Perform
- [ ] Review alert management system for backlog/aging
- [ ] Check ticketing system for security-related items
- [ ] Examine monitoring dashboards for response times
- [ ] Verify automated escalation processes

### Interview Targets
- [ ] **Security Manager**: Alert processing, external findings, budget challenges
- [ ] **IT Operations**: Day-to-day security vs. efficiency conflicts
- [ ] **Finance/Budget Owner**: Security investment decisions
- [ ] **HR/General Staff**: Security reporting culture and experience

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Start Here**: Check security alert response time
- **If 80%+ alerts resolved <30 days** ‚Üí Continue to External Assessment
- **If <80% alerts resolved <30 days** ‚Üí YELLOW minimum

**External Assessment Check**:
- **If external findings addressed on timeline** ‚Üí Continue to Budget
- **If external findings delayed/disputed** ‚Üí RED likely

**Budget Stability Check**:
- **If security budget protected during cuts** ‚Üí Continue to Culture
- **If security budget routinely reduced** ‚Üí RED likely

**Culture/Response Check**:
- **If incident analysis focuses on internal improvements** ‚Üí GREEN likely
- **If incident analysis blames external factors** ‚Üí YELLOW/RED

**Final Determination**:
- **GREEN**: 6-7 criteria met, proactive security culture
- **YELLOW**: 4-5 criteria met, inconsistent responses
- **RED**: 0-3 criteria met, systematic defensive patterns

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Walk me through what happens when you receive a security threat alert."**
- *Follow-up*: "How long does it typically take to act on these alerts?"
- *Red Flag*: Vague timelines, "we review them" without action

**"Tell me about your last external security assessment."**
- *Follow-up*: "How did you prioritize and address the findings?"
- *Red Flag*: Disputed findings, delayed remediation, budget constraints

**"How does your organization handle security incidents?"**
- *Follow-up*: "What did you learn from your last incident?"
- *Red Flag*: Blame on attackers/vendors, no internal improvements

### Deeper Investigation Prompts
**If defensive patterns emerge:**
- "Can you show me examples of recent security improvements?"
- "How do you balance security with operational efficiency?"
- "What happens when security conflicts with business deadlines?"

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics
- **Instead of**: "Your organization is in denial"
- **Say**: "I'm seeing some gaps between security intentions and implementation"

- **Instead of**: "You're projecting blame"
- **Say**: "Let's explore internal factors that could strengthen your security posture"
