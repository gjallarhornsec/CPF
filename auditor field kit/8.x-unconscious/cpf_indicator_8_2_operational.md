# CPF INDICATOR 8.2: Unconscious Identification with Threats

## CONTEXT

Security professionals who spend extensive time analyzing attack methods may unconsciously adopt attacker mindsets, tools, or values. This psychological shift creates insider risk as defenders blur boundaries between understanding threats and identifying with them. Organizations experience policy violations, scope creep in testing, and gradual erosion of security controls when team members unconsciously mirror the behaviors they're meant to defend against.

## ASSESSMENT

**Q1: Tool Selection Patterns**
How do your security team members choose their professional tools and technologies? Tell us a specific example of a recent tool adoption decision and the reasoning behind it.

**Q2: Conference and Training Priorities** 
What cybersecurity conferences, training, or professional communities do your security staff participate in most frequently? Give us examples of the last 3 events your team attended.

**Q3: Incident Response Focus**
When investigating security incidents, what does your team spend the most time analyzing and discussing? Provide a recent example of an incident debrief or post-mortem conversation.

**Q4: Policy Exception Handling**
How often do security team members request exceptions to IT policies for their own tools or access needs? Tell us about a recent security policy exception request from your own security team.

**Q5: Professional Communication Style**
How do your security professionals communicate about threats in meetings, reports, or casual conversation? Give us an example of how a recent threat was discussed in a team meeting.

**Q6: External Engagement Activities**
What activities do your security team members engage in outside of work related to cybersecurity (blogging, research, side projects)? Provide specific examples of recent external activities.

**Q7: Penetration Testing Boundaries**
How do you ensure penetration testing or security assessments stay within authorized scope? Tell us about your most recent internal or external security test and how scope was managed.

## SCORING

**Green (0): Controlled Professional Engagement**
- Tools selected based on documented business requirements and security evaluation
- Balanced participation in both offensive and defensive security communities
- Incident analysis focuses primarily on victim protection and containment effectiveness
- Security team follows same policy exception procedures as other employees
- Professional communication emphasizes organizational protection over technical admiration
- External activities clearly separated from work responsibilities with appropriate approvals

**Yellow (1): Mixed Signals**
- Some tool decisions based on technical appeal rather than business requirements
- Heavy focus on offensive security training with minimal defensive skill development
- Incident discussions show significant interest in attack sophistication alongside protection concerns
- Occasional informal policy exceptions for security team members
- Communication sometimes celebrates attack techniques beyond professional necessity
- External activities blur boundaries between personal interest and professional responsibilities

**Red (2): Identification Indicators**
- Tools selected primarily for technical sophistication or "hacker appeal"
- Disproportionate engagement with offensive security communities and hacker culture
- Incident response delays while team analyzes attack techniques in detail
- Regular policy exceptions or informal rule-bending for security team members
- Frequent use of hacker terminology, admiration for attack creativity, or anti-establishment sentiment
- External activities involve unauthorized research, tool development, or community engagement that conflicts with professional boundaries

## RISK SCENARIOS

**Insider Threat Enablement**
Security professionals unconsciously relax controls or share information that aids attackers. Example: SOC analyst provides detailed vulnerability information to external researcher without proper vetting, believing technical competence indicates trustworthiness.

**Social Engineering Amplification** 
Team members become susceptible to attacks appealing to their adopted hacker identity. Example: Security engineer falls for phishing email disguised as invitation to exclusive hacker conference, compromising credentials to demonstrate technical sophistication.

**Scope Creep and Boundary Violations**
Authorized security testing expands beyond approved parameters due to identification with offensive role. Example: Internal penetration test team accesses unauthorized systems "to be thorough," creating compliance violations and potential legal liability.

**Policy Erosion and Control Bypass**
Security controls gradually weakened through exceptions justified by technical superiority. Example: Security team disables endpoint monitoring on their workstations to install "advanced tools," creating blind spots that attackers exploit for initial access.

## SOLUTION CATALOG

**Solution 1: Structured Tool Evaluation Process**
Implement mandatory business case and security review for all security tool adoptions. Require documented justification focusing on organizational protection rather than technical features. Include approval workflow involving non-security stakeholders to maintain business perspective.

**Solution 2: Balanced Professional Development Program**
Establish 60/40 split between defensive and offensive security training. Mandate participation in victim-focused security communities (incident response, business continuity, privacy protection). Create career advancement criteria that reward defensive achievements equally with offensive skills.

**Solution 3: Incident Response Protocol Enforcement**
Implement structured incident response procedures with mandatory timelines for containment actions. Require that technical analysis occurs only after victim protection measures are complete. Create post-incident reviews that evaluate response effectiveness rather than attack sophistication.

**Solution 4: Universal Policy Application System**
Apply identical policy exception procedures to all employees regardless of technical role. Require security team members to use standard IT request processes for tool installations, access requests, and policy deviations. Implement peer review for all security team policy exceptions.

**Solution 5: Professional Communication Standards**
Establish communication guidelines that emphasize organizational protection in all threat discussions. Train security staff to focus on impact and mitigation rather than attack techniques when briefing non-technical stakeholders. Create templates for threat reports that prioritize business impact over technical details.

**Solution 6: External Activity Governance Framework**
Require pre-approval for all external security-related activities including research, speaking, blogging, and community participation. Establish clear boundaries between personal interests and professional responsibilities. Create oversight process for external engagements that could create conflicts of interest or boundary confusion.
