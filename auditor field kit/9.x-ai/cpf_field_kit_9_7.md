## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check YES/NO for each observable indicator:**

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization has written policy requiring verification of AI security recommendations before implementation

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Staff can show you documentation of AI recommendation verification from the last 30 days

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: There are technical workflow controls that prevent high-impact AI recommendations from bypassing human review

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Staff receive specific training on identifying and questioning AI-generated content

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization maintains audit trails showing verification status of AI-generated security decisions

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Staff express comfort questioning AI recommendations when asked directly

‚ñ° **YES/NO**: Organization has identified and corrected AI errors in security content within the last 90 days

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### **Documents to Request:**
- [ ] AI verification policy or procedures document
- [ ] Last 5 security decisions involving AI recommendations (with verification records)
- [ ] Training materials mentioning AI content verification
- [ ] Recent security meeting minutes citing AI-generated content
- [ ] Incident reports involving AI recommendation errors (if any)

### **System Demonstrations:**
- [ ] "Show me your process for implementing an AI security recommendation"
- [ ] "Walk through your standard security decision workflow"
- [ ] "Demonstrate how you verify AI-generated threat intelligence"
- [ ] "Show me your AI content audit trail system"

### **Key Interviews:**
- [ ] **Security Manager**: Ask about verification policies and compliance
- [ ] **IT Staff Member**: Ask about day-to-day AI recommendation handling
- [ ] **Recent Decision Maker**: Ask about last major AI-influenced security decision
- [ ] **Training Coordinator**: Ask about AI-specific skepticism training

### **System Checks:**
- [ ] Review dashboards for AI verification metrics
- [ ] Check for human approval gates in AI-assisted workflows
- [ ] Examine recent AI-generated security reports for verification status
- [ ] Test whether AI recommendations can bypass review processes

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Follow this decision tree:**

### **GREEN (0) - Low Risk**
**If ALL of these are true:**
- Written verification policy exists AND is being followed
- Multiple recent examples show systematic verification
- Staff comfortable questioning AI recommendations
- Technical controls prevent unverified AI implementation

### **RED (2) - High Risk**
**If ANY of these are true:**
- No verification policy or systematic process exists
- Staff resistant to questioning AI recommendations
- High-impact decisions made directly on AI content without verification
- No examples of AI error detection in recent history

### **YELLOW (1) - Medium Risk**
**Everything else falls here:**
- Some verification processes but inconsistently applied
- Mixed staff comfort levels with questioning AI
- Verification steps sometimes bypassed due to time pressure
- Limited examples of systematic verification

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### **Opening Questions:**
- "How does your team currently handle AI-generated security recommendations?"
- "Can you walk me through your last major security decision that involved AI input?"
- "What's your organization's policy on verifying AI-provided information?"

### **Follow-up Prompts:**
- **If they mention verification:** "Show me an example of your verification documentation"
- **If they seem confident in AI:** "Have you ever discovered errors in AI recommendations?"
- **If they lack formal process:** "How do you ensure AI recommendations are accurate?"
- **If staff seem uncomfortable:** "What happens when someone questions an AI recommendation?"

### **Red Flag Indicators:**
- Staff cannot provide verification examples
- Defensive responses about AI questioning
- No documentation of verification steps
- Claims that AI verification is unnecessary
- Examples of unverified high-impact AI decisions

### **Professional Probes:**
- "Help me understand your decision-making workflow when AI provides security guidance"
- "What controls prevent potentially harmful AI recommendations from being implemented?"
- "How does your organization balance AI efficiency with verification requirements?"
