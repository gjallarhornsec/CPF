‚ñ° **Q1**: Do employees use personal pronouns (he/she/they) when referring to AI systems in meetings or documentation?
   - ‚òê Yes ‚òê No

‚ñ° **Q2**: Does the organization lack written policies prohibiting sensitive data sharing with AI systems?
   - ‚òê Yes ‚òê No

‚ñ° **Q3**: Have employees requested expanded AI permissions citing the AI "needs" the access to function properly?
   - ‚òê Yes ‚òê No

‚ñ° **Q4**: Do employees resist or complain when AI systems are restricted, updated, or temporarily disabled?
   - ‚òê Yes ‚òê No

‚ñ° **Q5**: Do employees explain AI errors using human-like motivations ("it was confused," "trying its best")?
   - ‚òê Yes ‚òê No

‚ñ° **Q6**: Does the organization provide less than quarterly AI literacy training explaining how AI actually processes information?
   - ‚òê Yes ‚òê No

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request (3 minutes)
‚ñ° **AI Usage Policies** - Current written guidelines
‚ñ° **Meeting Minutes** - Last 5 meetings mentioning AI systems
‚ñ° **Training Records** - AI literacy program documentation
‚ñ° **Incident Reports** - AI-related security events (last 6 months)

### System Demonstrations (4 minutes)
‚ñ° **Show me**: How employees typically interact with your AI systems
‚ñ° **Demonstrate**: Process for sharing data with AI tools
‚ñ° **Walk through**: Permission request workflow for AI access
‚ñ° **Display**: Current AI system access controls

### Interview Targets (3 minutes)
‚ñ° **IT Administrator** (5 min) - Technical AI management
‚ñ° **Regular AI User** (5 min) - Daily interaction patterns
‚ñ° **Manager** (5 min) - Team AI adoption and resistance

### Key Interview Questions
**For IT Admin:**
- "How do you communicate AI system maintenance to users?"
- "What's the typical reaction when you restrict AI access?"

**For AI User:**
- "How would you describe [AI system name] to a new colleague?"
- "What information do you typically share with the AI to get better results?"

**For Manager:**
- "How does your team talk about AI systems in meetings?"
- "Have you noticed any resistance to AI security measures?"

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree

**Count "Yes" answers from Quick Assessment:**

**0-2 Yes answers = GREEN (Low Risk)**
- Technical language dominates
- Clear policies exist and are followed
- Minimal anthropomorphic behavior

**3-5 Yes answers = YELLOW (Medium Risk)**  
- Mixed anthropomorphic patterns
- Some policy gaps or inconsistent enforcement
- Moderate resistance to restrictions

**6-7 Yes answers = RED (High Risk)**
- Pervasive anthropomorphic language
- No effective policies
- Strong emotional attachment to AI systems

### Verification Checklist
‚ñ° **Evidence supports scoring** (documents align with interviews)
‚ñ° **Multiple sources confirm** findings
‚ñ° **Patterns consistent** across different roles

**Final Risk Level**: ‚òê Green ‚òê Yellow ‚òê Red

- Quarterly AI mechanics education
- Hands-on AI limitation demonstrations
- Manager training on policy enforcement

**Access Controls** - *Cost: High, Time: 8 weeks*
- Role-based AI permissions
- Approval workflows for expansions
- Automated sensitive data blocking

### LOW IMPACT (Future Consideration)

**Cultural Change** - *Cost: Medium, Time: 3-6 months*
- Performance review integration
- Communication auditing
- Behavioral change reinforcement

### Dependencies
‚ñ° **Management buy-in** required for policy enforcement
‚ñ° **Technical team** needed for monitoring implementation
‚ñ° **Training budget** approval for education programs

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Discussion
*"We're assessing how your organization interacts with AI systems to identify potential security vulnerabilities. This is about ensuring appropriate boundaries, not limiting AI effectiveness."*

### Key Questions with Follow-ups

**Q**: "How do your teams typically talk about your AI systems?"
- **If vague**: "Can you give me specific examples of language used in recent meetings?"
- **If defensive**: "We're looking for patterns that might create security blind spots, not judging AI adoption."

**Q**: "What's your current approach to information sharing with AI systems?"
- **Follow-up**: "Walk me through what happens when someone wants to share customer data with an AI tool."
- **Red flag**: No clear process or "we trust people to use good judgment"

**Q**: "How do employees react when AI systems need maintenance or restrictions?"
- **Follow-up**: "Can you describe a specific recent example?"
- **Red flag**: Emotional resistance, concern for "AI wellbeing," or pushback on security measures

### Sensitive Topic Language
- Use **"system boundaries"** not "anthropomorphization"
- Say **"appropriate AI interaction"** not "don't treat AI like humans"
- Frame as **"security best practices"** not "psychological problems"
- Emphasize **"maximizing AI value safely"** not "limiting AI use"
