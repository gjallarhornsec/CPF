   - YES: Written procedures for bias complaints/investigations
   - NO: No documented fairness incident process

‚ñ° **6. Staff Training**: Have security/IT staff received AI bias awareness training?
   - YES: Training records show bias-focused AI sessions
   - NO: No AI bias training in past 12 months

‚ñ° **7. Budget Allocation**: Is budget specifically allocated to AI fairness tools/services?
   - YES: Line items for bias detection tools/consultants
   - NO: No dedicated fairness spending identified

‚ñ° **AI/Data Team Lead**: Technical bias testing capabilities and processes  
‚ñ° **Compliance Officer**: Regulatory requirements and fairness oversight
‚ñ° **HR Representative**: Employee fairness concerns and incident handling

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Decision Tree - Follow path based on evidence:**

### GREEN (0) - Low Risk
**IF** 5+ Quick Assessment items = YES **AND** All required documents exist **AND** Recent bias testing completed
‚Üí **GREEN**: Systematic fairness approach in place

### YELLOW (1) - Medium Risk  
**IF** 3-4 Quick Assessment items = YES **OR** Some processes exist but incomplete/inconsistent
‚Üí **YELLOW**: Partial fairness awareness, needs strengthening

### RED (2) - High Risk
**IF** 0-2 Quick Assessment items = YES **OR** No bias testing in past 12 months **OR** Dismissive attitudes toward fairness
‚Üí **RED**: Significant fairness blindness, immediate attention required

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT - Implement First (Cost: Medium)
‚ñ° **AI Bias Testing Protocol**: Quarterly testing for all AI security systems
   - **Quick Win**: Start with automated bias detection tools
   - **Dependencies**: Technical team training, testing methodology

‚ñ° **Diverse Oversight Committee**: Cross-functional AI governance team

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"Walk me through how you selected your current AI security tools."**
- **Listen for**: Fairness evaluation, diverse input, bias testing requirements
- **Red Flag**: Only technical/cost considerations mentioned

**"Tell me about a time someone raised concerns about unfair treatment by your AI systems."**
- **Listen for**: Formal process, investigation steps, resolution approach
- **Red Flag**: "That's never happened" or dismissive response

### Follow-Up Prompts
**If no bias testing mentioned:**
- "How do you ensure your AI doesn't discriminate against certain employee groups?"
- "What would you do if your AI security system missed threats from specific populations?"

**If defensive about fairness:**
- "What compliance requirements do you have around AI fairness?"
- "How do you verify vendor claims about AI objectivity?"

### Professional Escalation Language
**For sensitive findings:**
- "Industry best practices now require systematic bias evaluation..."
- "Regulatory trends suggest increased scrutiny of AI fairness..."
- "Risk management frameworks now include AI discrimination as key vulnerability..."
