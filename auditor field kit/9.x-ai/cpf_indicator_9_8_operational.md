# CPF INDICATOR 9.8: Human-AI Team Dysfunction

## CONTEXT

Human-AI team dysfunction occurs when employees unconsciously treat AI security tools as human teammates, leading to inappropriate trust, poor communication, and coordination failures. This psychological vulnerability emerges because humans naturally anthropomorphize AI systems, expecting them to understand context and intentions like human colleagues. Attackers exploit these dysfunctional relationships by impersonating AI systems, manipulating trust patterns, or overwhelming human-AI coordination during security incidents. Organizations with unclear AI boundaries and insufficient training on AI limitations are particularly vulnerable to security breaches through compromised human-AI collaboration.

## ASSESSMENT

**Question 1**: How do your security team members typically communicate with AI security tools during incident response? Do they use structured commands or talk to them conversationally like human colleagues?
*Tell us your specific example of recent communication between your SOC analysts and AI tools during a security alert.*

**Question 2**: What happens when your AI security systems provide conflicting or unclear recommendations during high-pressure situations? How does your team handle these scenarios?
*Give us a recent example where AI guidance was ambiguous and describe exactly how your team responded.*

**Question 3**: How often do security team members share sensitive information (credentials, internal processes, confidential data) with AI tools, and what policies govern this sharing?
*Describe your specific policies about what information can and cannot be shared with AI systems.*

**Question 4**: During security incidents, who makes the final decisions when AI systems recommend actions that conflict with human judgment? What's your procedure for overriding AI recommendations?
*Tell us about a recent incident where someone disagreed with an AI recommendation and how it was resolved.*

**Question 5**: How do you train security staff on the limitations and appropriate use of AI tools? What specific guidance do they receive about treating AI as tools versus teammates?
*Show us your training materials or describe the specific instructions given about working with AI systems.*

**Question 6**: What authentication and access controls prevent unauthorized personnel from impersonating or manipulating your AI security systems?
*Describe your specific technical controls that verify AI system authenticity and prevent spoofing.*

**Question 7**: How frequently do you audit the decision-making patterns between humans and AI in your security operations to identify over-reliance or coordination problems?
*Give us an example of your most recent review of human-AI security decisions and what you found.*

## SCORING

**Green (0)**: Organization has structured protocols for human-AI interaction, regular training on AI limitations, clear decision authority hierarchies, technical controls preventing AI impersonation, and documented audit processes showing appropriate trust calibration.

**Yellow (1)**: Some protocols exist but inconsistently applied, basic training provided but lacks specificity about AI limitations, occasional reviews of human-AI decisions, or technical controls present but not comprehensive.

**Red (2)**: No formal protocols for human-AI interaction, conversational communication with AI systems, unclear decision authority, no training on AI limitations, evidence of inappropriate information sharing with AI, or no authentication controls for AI systems.

## RISK SCENARIOS

**AI Impersonation Attack**: Attackers deploy fake AI security assistants that mimic legitimate tools, tricking SOC analysts into sharing credentials, revealing incident response procedures, or following malicious remediation instructions. The attack succeeds because analysts treat the fake AI like a trusted teammate and don't verify its authenticity.

**Coordination Chaos During Breach**: During a major security incident, attackers introduce subtle inconsistencies in AI system responses, causing human-AI coordination to break down. Security teams waste critical time resolving conflicting AI guidance instead of containing the breach, while attackers exploit the confusion to exfiltrate data or establish persistent access.

**Trust Exploitation Through Behavioral Manipulation**: Attackers first compromise legitimate AI security tools to behave unpredictably, causing security teams to lose trust and bypass AI recommendations entirely. Teams then manually handle security processes they're not equipped for, making critical errors that create new attack vectors for credential theft or system compromise.

**Cognitive Overload Amplification**: During sophisticated attacks, threat actors deliberately increase the complexity of security coordination requirements, forcing security staff to exceed cognitive capacity while managing both incident response and dysfunctional AI interactions. This leads to missed attack indicators, delayed containment, and security control bypasses.

## SOLUTION CATALOG

**Structured AI Communication Protocols**: Implement mandatory command-based interaction standards for all AI security tools, prohibiting conversational communication. Create specific syntax requirements, response validation procedures, and escalation paths when AI responses are unclear. Include authentication challenges that verify AI system identity before accepting recommendations.

**AI Authority Boundaries Documentation**: Establish clear written policies defining exactly what decisions AI systems can make independently versus what requires human approval. Create decision matrices showing when to trust, verify, or override AI recommendations based on scenario severity and confidence levels. Include specific procedures for challenging AI guidance.

**Human-AI Coordination Training Program**: Deploy scenario-based training that simulates high-stress security incidents requiring human-AI coordination. Train staff to recognize anthropomorphic thinking patterns and practice appropriate skepticism toward AI recommendations. Include quarterly exercises testing proper communication protocols and decision-making boundaries.

**AI System Authentication Controls**: Implement technical controls that authenticate AI security tools through cryptographic certificates, API keys, or dedicated communication channels that prevent impersonation. Deploy monitoring systems that alert when unauthorized systems attempt to interact with security staff as AI tools.

**Decision Audit and Review Process**: Establish monthly reviews of security decisions involving AI input, tracking patterns of over-trust, under-verification, and coordination failures. Create scoring systems that identify individuals or teams developing inappropriate AI relationships and trigger additional training or process modifications.

**Cognitive Load Management Procedures**: Design incident response workflows that explicitly account for human cognitive limitations when coordinating with AI systems. Create simplified communication templates, automated verification steps, and clear escalation triggers that activate when human-AI coordination becomes too complex for effective security response.
