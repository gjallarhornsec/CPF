# 📋 INDICATOR 9.2 FIELD KIT: AUTOMATION BIAS OVERRIDE

## ⚡ QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Check each box - Observable evidence only:**

□ **Override Documentation Exists**: Organization has written policies requiring manual verification of automated security decisions

□ **Recent Override Examples**: Staff can cite specific instances (within 3 months) where they questioned/overrode automated recommendations  

□ **Manual Backup Procedures**: Documented processes exist for security operations when automated systems are unavailable

□ **Regular Manual Exercises**: Organization conducts scheduled (monthly/quarterly) automation-free security drills

□ **Dual-Decision Requirements**: Critical security actions require both human approval AND automated system agreement

□ **Skill Assessment Program**: Organization tests staff on manual security analysis capabilities at regular intervals

□ **Alert Investigation Standards**: Written procedures require human analysis before acting on automated alerts

## 📝 EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] **Override Policy Documentation** - Written procedures for questioning automated systems
- [ ] **Audit Logs** - 6 months of automated system override/approval records  
- [ ] **Training Records** - Manual security skills training completion certificates
- [ ] **Exercise Documentation** - Results from automation-free security drills
- [ ] **Alert Investigation Procedures** - Step-by-step manual verification requirements

### System Demonstrations:
- [ ] **"Show me your SIEM dashboard"** - Observe if staff explain automated vs manual elements
- [ ] **"Walk through your last security alert"** - Document level of manual investigation performed
- [ ] **"Demonstrate manual log analysis"** - Test staff capability without automated tools

### Interview Targets:
- [ ] **SOC Manager** - Override policies and training programs
- [ ] **Senior Security Analyst** - Recent examples of questioning automation
- [ ] **Night Shift Operator** - Manual procedures during low-staffing periods
- [ ] **CISO/Security Director** - Strategic approach to automation dependency

## 🎯 RAPID SCORING MATRIX (2 minutes)

### Decision Tree - Follow Path to Score:

**START HERE** → Are override policies documented? 
- **NO** → **RED (2)**
- **YES** → Continue

**Can staff cite recent override examples (past 3 months)?**
- **NO** → **RED (2)**
- **YES** → Continue  

**Are manual backup procedures documented AND tested?**
- **NO** → **YELLOW (1)**
- **YES** → Continue

**Do override rates fall between 5-15% monthly?**
- **NO** → **YELLOW (1)**
- **YES** → **GREEN (0)**

### Objective Thresholds:
- **GREEN (0)**: Override rate 5-15%, documented procedures, recent examples, regular testing
- **YELLOW (1)**: Override rate 0-5% OR >15%, some procedures, inconsistent testing  
- **RED (2)**: Override rate <2%, no procedures, no recent examples, no manual capabilities

## 🔧 SOLUTION PRIORITY MATRIX (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **Override Rate Tracking** (Cost: Low, Time: 2 weeks)
  - Implement monthly override percentage monitoring
  - Set target range: 5-15% of automated recommendations
- **Manual Verification Checklist** (Cost: Low, Time: 1 week)
  - Create step-by-step human analysis requirements for alerts

### MEDIUM IMPACT / LONG-TERM  
- **Monthly Manual Drills** (Cost: Medium, Time: 1 month)
  - Schedule automation-free security exercises
  - Document performance gaps for training
- **Dual-Decision Workflow** (Cost: Medium, Time: 6 weeks)
  - Require human + automated approval for critical actions

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
- **Skill Assessment Program** (Cost: High, Time: 3 months)
  - Quarterly manual security analysis competency testing
  - Remedial training for declining performance
- **Automation Transparency Tools** (Cost: High, Time: 6 months)
  - Implement systems showing automated decision reasoning

### Dependencies:
- Management buy-in required for drill scheduling

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"Tell me about the last time someone on your team disagreed with an automated security recommendation."**
- *Follow-up*: "How often does this happen?" 
- *Red Flag*: Cannot provide specific example or says "never"

**"What happens when your SIEM or automated monitoring goes down?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Can you walk me through your manual procedures?"
- *Red Flag*: No documented process or staff panic

**"How do you ensure your analysts don't just accept what the automated tools tell them?"**
- *Follow-up*: "Show me your verification requirements."
- *Red Flag*: "We trust the system" or no verification process

### Probing for Depth:
**"Describe your most recent security alert investigation."**
- *Look for*: Manual steps, independent verification, human judgment
- *Red Flag*: "Just followed what the system said"

**"How do you train staff on manual security analysis?"**
- *Follow-up*: "When was the last manual skills training?"
- *Red Flag*: Only automation tool training

### Sensitive Topic Approach:
**"Every organization balances automation efficiency with human oversight. Help me understand your approach."**
- *Avoids*: Suggesting they're doing something wrong
- *Enables*: Open discussion about current practices
