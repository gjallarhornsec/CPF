## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

```
START HERE ‚Üì

Policy Documentation Present?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Training Conducted in 12 months?
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Monitoring System Active?
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Recent Incidents = 0?
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí GREEN (0)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí YELLOW (1)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí YELLOW (1)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí YELLOW (1)
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí RED (2)

If YELLOW: Check for 4+ controls present ‚Üí Stay YELLOW
If YELLOW: Check for 2- controls present ‚Üí Move to RED

If RED indicators present (any):
- Employees use emotional language about AI ("my AI", "poor system")
- Multiple security bypasses due to AI influence
- No verification of AI recommendations
- Resistance to AI system changes
‚Üí Confirm RED (2)

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT / QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
**Cost: Low** | **Timeline: 30 days**
- [ ] **Verification Checklist**: Mandatory human approval for AI security recommendations
- [ ] **Language Monitoring**: Flag personal pronouns in AI communications
- [ ] **Crisis Protocol**: Two-person confirmation for urgent AI requests

### HIGH IMPACT / LONG-TERM
**Cost: Medium** | **Timeline: 90 days**
- [ ] **Training Program**: Quarterly AI boundary awareness sessions
- [ ] **Rotation Policy**: 90-day AI system assignment changes
- [ ] **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time anthropomorphic language detection

### MEDIUM IMPACT / ONGOING
**Cost: Medium** | **Timeline: 180 days**
- [ ] **Communication Analysis**: NLP tools for relationship pattern detection
- [ ] **Decision Framework**: Cooling-off periods for AI recommendations
- [ ] **Cultural Assessment**: Regular surveys on AI relationship development

**Dependencies:**

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions
**"How do your employees typically interact with AI systems?"**
*Listen for: Personal language, emotional descriptions, resistance to changes*

**"What happens when an AI system makes an urgent request?"**
*Listen for: Bypass procedures, emotional urgency, lack of verification*

**"How do employees talk about your AI tools in meetings?"**
*Listen for: Anthropomorphic language, protective attitudes, personal attachment*

### Follow-up Prompts
- **If they mention "helpful AI"**: *"Can you give me a specific example of how it helped?"*
- **If policy exists**: *"Show me the last time this policy was enforced."*
- **If no incidents reported**: *"How would you know if someone bypassed security for an AI request?"*
- **If training mentioned**: *"What specific AI manipulation techniques were covered?"*

### Red Flag Indicators
üö© **Language**: "Our AI", "She/He", "AI feelings", "Poor system"
üö© **Behavior**: Defensive about AI monitoring, resistance to AI restrictions
üö© **Process**: No verification steps, informal AI request handling
üö© **Culture**: AI system changes cause employee anxiety/complaints

### Professional Responses
**For sensitive findings**: *"This is a common challenge as organizations adopt AI tools. Let's look at some quick wins to strengthen your security posture."*

**For resistance**: *"These controls actually help employees use AI more effectively by maintaining clear professional boundaries."*
