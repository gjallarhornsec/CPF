# üìã CPF INDICATOR 9.4 FIELD KIT: AI AUTHORITY TRANSFER

## ‚ö° QUICK ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Mark YES or NO for each item:**

‚ñ° **Written AI Decision Policy Exists**: Organization has documented policies requiring human verification of AI recommendations for security decisions

‚ñ° **Recent Verification Examples**: Client can provide specific examples (within 30 days) of employees questioning or verifying AI recommendations before implementation

‚ñ° **AI Override Authority Defined**: Clear written authority exists for when humans can override AI system recommendations

‚ñ° **Decision Documentation Required**: Formal process exists requiring documentation of why AI recommendations were accepted/rejected

‚ñ° **Normal Approval Chains Apply**: AI-generated recommendations must follow same escalation processes as human-generated recommendations

‚ñ° **AI Error Response Process**: Documented procedures exist for identifying and correcting AI system errors or bad recommendations

‚ñ° **Second Opinion Standard**: Employees routinely seek human second opinions on AI recommendations for security-related decisions

## üìù EVIDENCE COLLECTION (10 minutes)

### Documents to Request:
- [ ] **AI Usage Policies** (any documents governing AI system use in decision-making)
- [ ] **Decision Approval Workflows** (showing AI recommendation approval processes)
- [ ] **Training Records** (AI authority awareness education)
- [ ] **Recent Decision Logs** (past 30 days showing AI-influenced decisions)
- [ ] **Incident Response Examples** (cases where AI gave problematic advice)

### Demonstrations Needed:
- [ ] **"Show me how you document an AI-based decision"**
- [ ] **"Walk through your process when AI conflicts with policy"**
- [ ] **"Demonstrate your AI recommendation approval workflow"**

### System Checks:
- [ ] **AI Decision Logging**: Check if systems log AI recommendations alongside human decisions
- [ ] **Approval Workflows**: Verify technical controls requiring human validation of AI security recommendations
- [ ] **Audit Trails**: Confirm AI-influenced decisions are properly documented

### Interview Targets:
- [ ] **AI System Users** (employees who regularly use AI tools for decisions)
- [ ] **Security Team Members** (those responsible for security decision oversight)
- [ ] **IT Managers** (those overseeing AI system implementations)

## üéØ RAPID SCORING (2 minutes)

**Follow this decision tree:**

**GREEN (0)** = All conditions met:
- Written AI verification policies exist AND
- Recent examples of AI questioning/verification AND
- Clear AI override authority defined AND
- Documented AI decision processes working

**YELLOW (1)** = Mixed conditions:
- Some policies exist but inconsistently applied OR
- Few recent examples of appropriate AI skepticism OR
- Unclear AI override authority OR
- Inconsistent AI decision documentation

**RED (2)** = Major gaps present:
- No formal AI verification processes OR
- No recent examples of questioning AI recommendations OR
- Staff routinely implement AI suggestions without validation OR
- "AI recommends" used as sole justification for decisions

## üîß SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH IMPACT - QUICK IMPLEMENTATION
- **AI Decision Verification Protocol** (Cost: Low, Time: 1-2 weeks)
  - Require second-human approval for AI security decisions
  - Create digital forms documenting AI + human analysis

### MEDIUM IMPACT - MODERATE IMPLEMENTATION  
- **AI Authority Calibration Training** (Cost: Medium, Time: 4-6 weeks)
  - Deploy training modules on when to trust/question AI
  - Include hands-on exercises with flawed AI recommendations

- **AI Recommendation Audit Trails** (Cost: Medium, Time: 6-8 weeks)
  - Implement logging of AI recommendations + human decisions
  - Create dashboards flagging bypassed approval processes

### LONG-TERM - HIGH COMPLEXITY
- **Technical AI Validation Controls** (Cost: High, Time: 3-6 months)
  - Deploy systems requiring human validation before AI implementation
  - Create automated approval routing based on risk levels

## üí¨ CLIENT CONVERSATION SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
**"When your team makes decisions based on AI recommendations, what's your standard process?"**

*Follow-up if vague*: **"Can you give me a specific example from the past month?"**

### Key Probing Questions:
**"How often do your employees seek second opinions before implementing AI suggestions?"**

**"What happens when an AI system recommendation conflicts with your security policies?"**

**"How do you handle situations where AI systems give incorrect advice?"**

### Red Flag Indicators - Investigate Further:
- **"The AI knows better than we do"**
- **"We always follow what the system recommends"**
- **"AI decisions don't need the same approval process"**
- **"Our AI system hasn't been wrong yet"**

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:
- Instead of "your employees blindly trust AI" ‚Üí **"help us understand your AI verification processes"**
- Instead of "dangerous over-reliance" ‚Üí **"opportunities to strengthen decision oversight"**
- Instead of "AI authority transfer vulnerability" ‚Üí **"balancing AI efficiency with human oversight"**
