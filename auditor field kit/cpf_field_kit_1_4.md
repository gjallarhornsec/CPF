**7 YES answers** → **GREEN (0 points)**
- Comprehensive authority verification system
- All controls present and enforced

**4-6 YES answers** → **YELLOW (1 point)**  
- Partial controls exist but gaps present
- Inconsistent application likely

**0-3 YES answers** → **RED (2 points)**
- Minimal or no authority verification
- High vulnerability to CEO fraud/impersonation

## 🔧 SOLUTION PRIORITIES (5 minutes)

### HIGH Impact / LOW Cost (Implement First):
- **Authority Verification Protocol** - Create callback procedures with verified contact list
- **Email Warning System** - Flag external emails claiming executive authority  
- **Training Scripts** - Provide employees with polite verification language

### HIGH Impact / MEDIUM Cost (Next Phase):
- **Dual Authorization System** - Require two-person approval for authority exceptions
- **Time Delay Controls** - Mandatory 2-4 hour cooling off for authority overrides
- **Policy Protection** - Written policy protecting employees who verify requests

### MEDIUM Impact / HIGH Cost (Long-term):
- **Advanced Email Security** - AI-powered executive impersonation detection
- **Behavioral Analytics** - Monitor patterns in authority-based requests
- **Cultural Change Program** - Organization-wide authority-questioning training

### Dependencies:
- **Executive Buy-in** required for time delays and verification requirements
- **Legal Review** needed for employee protection policies
- **IT Resources** required for system automation

## 💬 CLIENT CONVERSATION (3 minutes)

### Opening Questions:
> *"In the past 6 months, how often have employees needed to bypass security procedures because an executive or manager asked them to?"*

**Follow-up if they say "never":** 
> *"What about password sharing, after-hours access, or urgent file transfers requested by leadership?"*

### Probing Questions:
> *"Walk me through what happens when someone calls saying they're the CEO and need immediate system access."*

> *"If an employee receives an urgent email from your CEO requesting a wire transfer, what verification steps are required?"*

> *"Has anyone ever been disciplined for questioning or delaying a request that claimed to come from executives?"*

### Red Flag Indicators:
- **Hesitation** when describing verification procedures
- **"We trust our executives"** - No verification process
- **Time pressure examples** - "When CEO needs something urgent..."  
- **Fear mentions** - "Employees don't want to question leadership"

### Professional Language for Sensitive Topics:
> *"This assessment helps identify where attackers might impersonate your executives - it's about protecting leadership, not questioning their authority."*

> *"Strong verification procedures actually protect executives from being impersonated and blamed for fraudulent requests."*
