## Implementation Notes

The CPF framework uses a ternary scoring system (Green/Yellow/Red) for each indicator and maintains privacy through aggregated behavioral pattern analysis without individual profiling. Future development includes machine learning integration, cultural adaptation, and standardization efforts.

For detailed assessment methodology and validation studies, refer to the complete CPF documentation.
